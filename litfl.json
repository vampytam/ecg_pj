  "Accelerated idioventricular rhythm": "Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR) Overview\nAIVR, also known as Accelerated Ventricular Rhythm, results when the rate of an ectopic ventricular pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node. Often associated with increased vagal tone and decreased sympathetic tone.\nECG Features of AIVR\nRegular rhythm\nRate typically 50-120 bpm\nThree or more ventricular complexes; QRS duration > 120ms\nFusion and capture beats\n\nPathophysiology\nProposed mechanism is enhanced automaticity of ventricular pacemaker, although triggered activity may play a role, particularly in ischaemia and digoxin toxicity\nAIVR is classically seen in the reperfusion phase of an acute STEMI , e.g. post thrombolysis\nUsually a well-tolerated, benign, self-limiting arrhythmia\n\nVentricular Rate\nNote that the rate of AIVR distinguishes it from others rhythms of similar morphology:\nRates < 50 bpm are consistent with a Ventricular Escape Rhythm\nRates > 110 bpm are consistent with Ventricular Tachycardia\n\nCauses of Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR)\nThere are multiple causes of AIVR including:\nReperfusion phase of acute myocardial infarction (MI) — most common cause\nBeta-sympathomimetics such as isoprenaline or adrenaline\nDrug toxicity, especially digoxin, cocaine and volatile anaesthetics such as desflurane\nElectrolyte abnormalities\nCardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, myocarditis\nReturn of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) following cardiac arrest — this probably relates to reperfusion of acute MI as underlying cause of arrest\nAthletic heart\n\nManagement\nAIVR is a benign rhythm in most settings and does not usually require treatment\nUsually self limiting and resolves when sinus rate exceeds that of the ventricular foci\nAdministration of anti-arrhythmics may cause precipitous haemodynamic deterioration and should be avoided\nTreat the underlying cause: e.g. correct electrolytes, restore myocardial perfusion\nPatients with low cardiac output states (e.g. severe biventricular failure) may benefit from restoration of AV synchrony to restore atrial kick – in this case atropine may be trialed in an attempt to increase sinus rate and AV conduction\n\nIsorhythmic AV dissociation\nThis refers to AV dissociation with sinus and ventricular complexes occurring at identical rates . This is in contrast to complete heart block , where the atrial rate is usually faster than the ventricular rate.\nIsorhythmic AV dissociation is usually due to functional block at the AV node due to retrograde ventricular impulses. These ventricular impulses depolarise the AV node, leaving it refractory to incoming sinus impulses (= “ interference-dissociation ”). I dentical rates in isorhythmic AV dissociation can create the illusional of an association between the two chambers.",
  "Accelerated junctional rhythm": "Accelerated Junctional Rhythm Overview\nAccelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) occurs when the rate of an AV junctional pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node. This situation arises when there is increased automaticity in the AV node coupled with decreased automaticity in the sinus node.\nECG Features of AJR\nNarrow complex rhythm; QRS duration < 120ms (unless pre-existing bundle branch block or rate-related aberrant conduction)\nVentricular rate usually 60 – 100 bpm\nRetrograde P waves may be present and can appear before, during or after the QRS complex. They are usually inverted in inferior leads (II, III, aVF), upright in aVR + V1\nAV dissociation may be present with the ventricular rate usually greater than the atrial rate\nThere may be associated ECG features of digoxin effect or digoxin toxicity\n\n\nCauses of Accelerated Junctional Rhythm\nAnything that disrupts electrical activity in the SA node can precipitate AJR. Common causes include:\nDigoxin toxicity (= the classic cause of AJR)\nBeta-agonists, e.g. isoprenaline, adrenaline\nMyocardial ischaemia\nMyocarditis\nCardiac surgery\n\nTerminology\nJunctional rhythms are arbitrarily classified by their rate :\nJunctional bradycardia: < 40 bpm\nJunctional Escape Rhythm: 40-60 bpm\nAccelerated Junctional Rhythm: 60-100 bpm\nJunctional Tachycardia: > 100 bpm\n\nThey may also be classified by aetiology :\nAutomatic Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AJR) = Due to enhanced automaticity in AV nodal cells\nRe-entrant Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AVNRT ) = Due to re-entrant loop involving AV node\n\n\n\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of AJR\nRapid AJR may be difficult to distinguish from re-entrant junctional tachycardias such as AVNRT or AVRT .\nIrregularity of rhythm and heart-rate variability are suggestive of automatic junctional tachycardia\nAutomatic junctional tachycardia is typically non-responsive to vagal manoeuvres — there may be some transient slowing of the ventricular rate but reversion to sinus rhythm will not occur\n\nNOTE : AJR with aberrant conduction may be difficult to distinguish from accelerated idioventricular rhythm . The presence of fusion or capture beats indicates a ventricular rather than junctional focus.",
  "Anterior STEMI": "ECG Features of Anterior STEMI\nST segment elevation with subsequent Q wave formation in precordial leads (V1-6) +/- high lateral leads. These changes are often preceded by hyperacute T waves\nReciprocal ST depression in inferior leads (mainly III and aVF)\nNB: The magnitude of reciprocal change in inferior leads is determined by the magnitude of ST elevation in I and aVL (as these leads are electrically opposite III and aVF), and hence may be minimal or absent in anterior STEMIs that do not involve high lateral leads.\n\nClinical Relevance of Anterior Myocardial Infarction\nAnterior STEMI usually results from occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) . Anterior myocardial infarction carries the poorest prognosis of all infarct locations, due to the larger area of myocardium infarct size.\nA study comparing outcomes from anterior and inferior infarctions (STEMI + NSTEMI) found that compared with inferior MI, patients with anterior MI had higher incidences of:\nIn-hospital mortality (11.9 vs 2.8%)\nTotal mortality (27 vs 11%)\nHeart failure (41 vs 15%)\nSignificant ventricular ectopic activity (70 vs 59%)\nLower ejection fraction on admission (38 vs 55%)\nIn addition to anterior STEMI, other high-risk presentations of anterior ischaemia include left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis , Wellens syndrome and De Winter T waves .\n\nPatterns of Anterior Infarction\nThe nomenclature of anterior infarction can be confusing, with multiple different terms used for the various infarction patterns. The following is a simplified approach to naming the different types of anterior MI.\nThe precordial leads can be classified as follows:\nSeptal leads = V1-2\nAnterior leads = V3-4\nLateral leads = V5-6\n\nThe different infarct patterns are named according to the leads with maximal ST elevation:\nSeptal = V1-2\nAnterior = V2-5\nAnteroseptal = V1-4\nAnterolateral = V3-6, I + aVL\nExtensive anterior  / anterolateral = V1-6, I + aVL\nNB: While these definitions are intuitive, there is often a poor correlation between ECG features and precise infarct location as determined by imaging or autopsy. For an alternative approach to the naming of myocardial infarctions, take a look at this 2006 article from Circulation .\n\nClinical Pearls\nOther important ECG patterns to be aware of:\nAnterior-inferior STEMI due to occlusion of a “ wraparound ” LAD . This presents with simultaneous ST elevation in the precordial and inferior leads, due to occlusion of a variant (“type III”) LAD that wraps around the cardiac apex to supply both the anterior and inferior walls of the left ventricle\nLeft main coronary artery stenosi s : widespread ST depression with ST elevation in aVR ≥ V1\nWellens syndrome : deep precordial T wave inversions or biphasic T waves in V2-3, indicating critical proximal LAD stenosis (a warning sign of imminent anterior infarction)\nDe Winter T waves : upsloping ST depression with symmetrically peaked T waves in the precordial leads; a “STEMI equivalent” indicating acute LAD occlusion.",

  "Ashman Phenomenon": "Description\nAshman phenomenon describes an aberrant ventricular conduction, usually of RBBB morphology, which follows a short R-R interval and preceding relatively prolonged R-R interval\nTypically seen with atrial fibrillation but can also occur with other supraventricular arrhythmias\nClinically on its own is asymptomatic and does not require any specific treatment\n\nAshman phenomenon. Occurs when a long RR interval is followed by a short RR interval and terminated by the aberrant QRS complex\n\nHistory of the Ashman Phenomenon\n1947 – Gouaux and Ashman reported that in atrial fibrillation, when a relatively long cycle was followed by a relatively short cycle, the beat with a short cycle often has Right Bundle Branch Block morphology.\n1983 – Fisch criteria for the diagnosis of Ashman phenomenon\n\n\nMechanism\nThe refractory period of the His-Purkinje system is proportional to the RR interval of the preceding beat. So, when two beats are separated by a long RR interval, the subsequent refractory period will be relatively long.\nIf a  premature supraventricular stimulus (short RR interval) follows a long RR interval whilst the His-Purkinje system is still refractory, then the conducted beat will appear abnormal. As the refractory period of the right bundle is slightly longer than the left, the aberrantly-conducted beat typically demonstrates a right bundle branch (RBBB) morphology.",
  "Aslanger Pattern (OMI)": "In April 2020, Aslanger et al identified a specific ECG pattern concerning for acute inferior occlusion MI (OMI) in patients with concomitant multi-vessel disease, that does not display contiguous ST-segment elevation or fulfil STEMI criteria. The publishers reviewed ECG and angiography findings from 1000 NSTEMI, 1000 control (no myocardial infarction), as well as inferior STEMI patients presenting during the same time period. The Aslanger Pattern was observed in 6.3% of NSTEMI patients and found to be a predictor of larger infarct size and higher mortality.\nECG Criteria\n1) Inferior STE isolated to lead III 2) Concomitant ST depression in any of V4-V6, with a positive/terminally positive T-wave 3) ST segment in V1 > V2\nAslanger pattern 2020 (1) STE in III but not in any other inferior lead, (2) ST depression in any of leads V4 to 6 (but not in V2) with a positive (at least terminally positive) T-wave, (3) ST in lead V1 higher than ST in V2.\nWhy is there not contiguous ST elevation?\nDiagram adapted from an original by Dr Stephen W. Smith\nIn cases of limited inferior wall injury, the ST vector of inferior MI localises the area of infarction and is typically directed inferiorly and rightwards (yellow arrow)\nThe ST vector of subendocardial ischaemia does not localise to the ischaemia and regardless of involved coronary region directs to lead aVR (blue arrow)\nThe resultant average ST vector directs rightwards, causing ST elevation only in lead III and aVR\nClinical significance\nConcurrent multi-vessel disease predisposes these patients to poor outcomes if there is delayed time to emergent reperfusion, and prompt recognition of this potential OMI should improve outcomes\nIdentification of the culprit lesion at the time of angiography may be difficult if there is multiple critical stenoses, and this pattern would guide lesions supplying the inferior wall to be opened first\nLimitations\nThe pattern was found to be present in 0.5% of patients without acute MI, which may be a result of chronic change from a previous ischaemic insult\nAcute inferior MI in the presence of previous infarctions may also change the overall orientation of the lesion vector causing a similiar pattern\nThis is an isolated, retrospective study and warrants a further analysis as a predictor of occlusion MI that would be responsive to emergent reperfusion therapy\nAssociated Persons\nEmre Aslanger ; Yeditepe University Hospital, Department of Cardiology, Istanbul, Turkey",
  "Atrial flutter": "ECG features of atrial flutter\nNarrow complex tachycardia\nRegular atrial activity at ~300 bpm\nLoss of the isoelectric baseline\n“Saw-tooth” pattern of inverted flutter waves in leads II, III, aVF\nUpright flutter waves in V1 that may resemble P waves\nVentricular rate depends on AV conduction ratio (see below)\nNote: the above pattern of inverted flutter waves in inferior leads and upright flutter waves in V1 occurs in atrial flutter due to anticlockwise reentry, which makes up 90% of cases.\nFixed AV conduction ratio (“AV block”)\nVentricular rate is a fraction of the atrial rate, for example:\n2:1 block = 150 bpm\n3:1 block = 100 bpm\n4:1 block = 75 bpm\nVariable AV conduction ratio\nThe ventricular response is irregular and may mimic atrial fibrillation (AF)\nOn closer inspection, there may be a pattern of alternating 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 conduction ratios\n\n\nPathophysiology of atrial flutter\nAtrial flutter is a form of supraventricular tachycardia caused by a re-entry circuit within the right atrium. The length of the re-entry circuit corresponds to the size of the right atrium, resulting in a fairly predictable atrial rate of around 300 bpm (range 200-400)\nVentricular rate is determined by the AV conduction ratio (“degree of AV block”). The most common AV ratio is 2:1, resulting in a ventricular rate of ~150 bpm\nHigher-degree blocks can occur — usually due to medications or underlying heart disease — resulting in lower rates of ventricular conduction, e.g. 3:1 or 4:1 block.\nAtrial flutter with 1:1 conduction can occur due to sympathetic stimulation, or in the presence of an accessory pathway. The administration of AV-nodal blocking agents to a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome can precipitate this\nAtrial flutter with 1:1 conduction is associated with severe haemodynamic instability and progression to ventricular fibrillation\nNB. The term “AV block” in the  context of atrial flutter is something of a misnomer. AV block is a  physiological response to rapid atrial rates and implies a normally functioning AV node.\n\nClassification\nThis is based on the anatomical location and direction of the re-entry circuit.\n\nTypical atrial flutter (common)\nSometimes known as type I flutter, this involves the IVC & tricuspid isthmus in the reentry circuit. Further classified based on the direction of the reentry circuit (anticlockwise or clockwise):\nAnticlockwise Reentry: Commonest form of atrial flutter (90% of cases). Retrograde atrial conduction produces:\nInverted flutter waves in leads II,III, aVF\nPositive flutter waves in V1 — may resemble upright P waves\nClockwise Reentry: This uncommon variant produces the opposite pattern:\nPositive flutter waves in leads II, III, aVF\nBroad, inverted flutter waves in V1\nInteratrial conduction during normal sinus rhythm occurs via Bachmann’s bundle (BB), the fossa ovalis, and the coronary sinus os\nWhilst patterns of interatrial conduction in atrial flutter are less well established, they are thought to occur via similar pathways\nIn both forms of typical atrial flutter, the reentrant circuit is formed in the right atrium. The left atrium is passively activated and is not necessary to maintain the tachycardia\n\nAtypical atrial flutter (uncommon)\nSometimes referred to as type II flutter, does not fulfill criteria for typical atrial flutter\nOften associated with higher atrial rates and rhythm instability\nLess amenable to treatment with ablation\n\nHandy Tips For Spotting Flutter\nRapid Recognition\nNarrow complex tachycardia at 150 bpm (range 130-170)? Yes -> Suspect flutter!\nTurn the ECG upside down and closely examine the inferior leads (II, III + aVF) for flutter waves\nVagal Manoeuvres +/- Adenosine\nAtrial flutter will not usually cardiovert with these techniques (unlike AVNRT ), although typically there will be a transient period of increased AV block during which flutter waves may be unmasked\nRR intervals\nIn atrial flutter with variable block the R-R intervals will be multiples of the P-P interval  —  e.g. assuming an atrial rate of 300bpm (P-P interval of 200 ms), the R-R interval would be 400 ms with 2:1 block, 600 ms with 3:1 block, and 800 ms with 4:1 block\nLook for identical R-R intervals occurring sporadically along the rhythm strip; then look to see whether there is a mathematical relationship between the various R-R intervals on the ECG\nIn contrast, atrial fibrillation will be completely irregular, with no patterns to be discerned within the R-R intervals",
  "Atrial fibrillation": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia. It is characterised by disorganised atrial electrical activity and contraction.\nThe incidence and prevalence of AF is increasing. Lifetime risk over the age of 40 years is ~25%. Complications of AF include haemodynamic instability, cardiomyopathy, cardiac failure, and embolic events such as stroke.\nECG Features of Atrial Fibrillation\nIrregularly irregular rhythm\nNo P waves\nAbsence of an isoelectric baseline\nVariable ventricular rate\nQRS complexes usually < 120ms, unless pre-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction\nFibrillatory waves may be present and can be either fine (amplitude < 0.5mm) or coarse (amplitude > 0.5mm)\nFibrillatory waves may mimic P waves leading to misdiagnosis\n\n\nMechanism of Atrial Fibrillation\nThe mechanisms underlying AF are not fully understood, but it requires an initiating event (focal atrial activity / PACs ) and substrate for maintenance (i.e. dilated left atrium). Proposed mechanisms include:\nFocal activation – in which AF originates from an area of focal activity. This activity may be triggered due to increased automaticity or from micro re-entry. Often located in the pulmonary veins.\nMultiple wavelet mechanism – in which multiple small wandering wavelets are formed. The fibrillation is maintained by re-entry circuits formed by some of the wavelets. This process is potentiated in the presence of a dilated LA — the larger surface area facilitates continuous waveform propagation.\n\n\nCauses of Atrial Fibrillation\nIschaemic heart disease\nHypertension\nValvular heart disease (esp. mitral stenosis / regurgitation)\nAcute infections\nElectrolyte disturbance ( hypokalaemia , hypomagnesaemia )\nThyrotoxicosis\nDrugs (e.g. sympathomimetics)\nAlcohol\nPulmonary embolus\nPericardial disease\nAcid-base disturbance\nPre-excitation syndromes\nCardiomyopathies: dilated , hypertrophic .\nPhaeochromocytoma\n\nOther features:\nAshman Phenomenon – aberrant ventricular conducted beats, usually of RBBB morphology , secondary to a long refractory period as determined by the preceding R-R interval\nThe ventricular response and thus ventricular rate in AF is dependent on several factors including vagal tone, other pacemaker foci, AV node function, refractory period, and medications\nAF is most commonly associated with a ventricular rate ~ 110 – 160\nAF is often described as having ‘rapid ventricular response’ once the ventricular rate is > 100 bpm.\n‘Slow’ AF is a term often used to describe AF with a ventricular rate < 60 bpm.\nCauses of ‘slow’ AF include hypothermia , digoxin toxicity , and medications.\nA connection between Sick Sinus Syndrome (SSS) or Sinus node dysfunction (SND) and atrial fibrillation (AF) has been recognized in the literature since the 1960s. There is some evidence to support AF inducing SND and some support for the notion that SND causes and promotes the development of AF. [ Sinus Node Dysfunction in Atrial Fibrillation: Cause or Effect? , 2008]\n\nClassification of Atrial Fibrillation\nClassification is dependent on the presentation and duration of atrial fibrillation as below:\nFirst episode – initial detection of AF regardless of symptoms or duration\nRecurrent AF – More than 2 episodes of AF\nParoxysmal AF – Self terminating episode < 7 days\nPersistent AF –  Not self terminating, duration > 7 days\nLong-standing persistent AF – > 1 year\nPermanent (Accepted) AF – Duration > 1 yr in which rhythm control interventions are not pursued or are unsuccessful\nNote paroxysmal AF of > 48 hr duration is unlikely to spontaneously revert to sinus rhythm and anticoagulation must be considered.\n\nManagement of Atrial Fibrillation\nManagement of atrial fibrillation is complex, and depends on the duration of atrial fibrillation, co-morbidities, underlying cause, symptoms, and age. Management can be considered in a step-wise manner:\nDiagnosis of atrial fibrillation\nAssessment of duration\nAssessment for anticoagulation\nRate or rhythm control\nTreatment of underlying / associated diseases\n\nGuidelines for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation\nA number of national and international guidelines exist for the management of AF including:\nEuropean Society of Cardiology Guidelines 2016\nAmerican College of Cardiology Foundation Atrial Fibrillation Toolkit\nCanadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines 2016\nNICE Guideline Atrial fibrillation management\n\nRisk of Stroke and Anticoagulation\nAtrial fibrillation is associated with disorganised atrial contraction and stasis within the left atrial appendage with associated thrombus formation and risk of embolic stroke\nAF associated with valvular disease has a particularly high risk of stroke\nGuideline recommendations for stroke prevention and anticoagulation also include atrial flutter due to the high likelihood of these patients developing AF\nAnticoagulation strategies may include NOACs, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel\nAnticoagulation guidelines are based on risk of stroke vs. risk of bleeding.\nStroke risk stratification requires either an assessment of risk factors or application of a risk score e.g. CHADS 2 or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc .\nCHADS2 calculator via MDCalc\nCHA2DS2-VASc calculator via MDCalc\n\nAtrial Fibrillation in Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome\nAtrial fibrillation can occur in up to 20% of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW)\nThe accessory pathway allows for rapid conduction directly to the ventricles bypassing the AV node\nRapid ventricular rates may result in degeneration to VT or VF\nECG features of Atrial Fibrillation in WPW:\nRate > 200 bpm\nIrregular rhythm\nWide QRS complexes due to abnormal ventricular depolarisation via accessory pathway\nQRS complexes change in shape and morphology\nAxis remains stable, unlikely polymorphic VT\nTreatment\nTreatment with AV nodal blocking drugs e.g. adenosine, calcium-channel blockers, beta-blockers may increase conduction via the accessory pathway with a resultant increase in ventricular rate and possible degeneration into VT or VF\nIn a haemodynamically unstable patient urgent synchronised DC cardioversion is required.\nMedical treatment options in a stable patient include procainamide or ibutilide, although DC cardioversion may be preferred",
  "Atrial ectopic beat / atrial premature beat": "A premature atrial complex (PAC) is a premature beat arising from ectopic pacemaking tissue within the atria. There is an abnormal P wave, usually followed by a normal QRS complex. AKA: Atrial ectopics, atrial extrasystoles, atrial premature beats, atrial premature depolarisations.\nECG features of PACs\nAbnormal (non-sinus) P wave usually followed by a normal QRS complex (< 120 ms)\nPost-extrasystolic pauses may be present — PACs that reach the SA node may depolarise it, causing the SA node to be “reset”, with a longer-than-normal interval before the next sinus beat arrives\nPACs may also be conducted aberrantly (usually RBBB morphology), or not conducted at all. P waves will still be visible in both cases\n\nUnlike with a premature ventricular complexe (PVC), the post-extrasystolic pause is not equal to double the preceding RR interval\n\nP wave morphology\nThe P wave typically has a different morphology and axis to the sinus P waves\nPACs arising close to the AV node (“low atrial” ectopics) cause retrograde activation of the atria, producing an inverted P wave with a relatively short PR interval ≥ 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC)\nThe abnormal P wave may be hidden in the preceding T wave, producing a “peaked” or “camel hump” appearance — if this is not appreciated the PAC may be mistaken for a premature junctional complex (PJC)\n\nAberrancy and “blocked” PACs\nPACs arriving early in the cycle may be conducted aberrantly, usually with a RBBB morphology (as the right bundle branch has a longer refractory period than the left). They can be differentiated from PVCs by the presence of a preceding P wave\nSimilarly, PACs arriving very early in the cycle may not be conducted to the ventricles at all. In this case, you will see an abnormal P wave that is not followed by a QRS complex (“blocked PAC”). It is usually followed by a compensatory pause as the sinus node resets\n\nOrigin of Ectopic Beats\nGroups of pacemaker cells throughout the conducting system are capable of spontaneous depolarisation\nThe rate of depolarisation decreases from top to bottom: fastest at the sinoatrial node; slowest within the ventricles\nEctopic impulses from subsidiary pacemakers are normally suppressed by more rapid impulses from above\nHowever, if an ectopic focus depolarises early enough — before the arrival of the next sinus impulse — it may “capture” the ventricles, producing a premature contraction\nPremature contractions (“ectopics”) are classified by their origin — atrial ( PAC ), junctional ( PJC ) or ventricular ( PVC )\n\nClassification of PACs\nPACs may be either:\nUnifocal – arising from a single ectopic focus; each PAC is identical.\nMultifocal – arising from two or more ectopic foci; multiple P-wave morphologies.\n\nPACs often occur in repeating patterns:\nBigeminy — every other beat is a PAC\nTrigeminy — every third beat is a PAC\nQuadrigeminy — every fourth beat is a PAC\nCouplet – two consecutive PACs\nTriplet — three consecutive PACs\n\nClinical significance of PACs\nPACs are a normal electrophysiological phenomenon not usually requiring investigation or treatment\nFrequent PACs may cause palpitations and a sense of the heart “skipping a beat”\nIn patients with underlying predispositions (e.g. left atrial enlargement, ischaemic heart disease, WPW), a PAC may be the trigger for the onset of a re-entry tachyarrhythmia — e.g. Atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , AVNRT , AVRT\n\nCauses of PACs\nFrequent or symptomatic PACs may occur due to:\nAnxiety\nSympathomimetics\nBeta-agonists\nExcess caffeine\nHypokalaemia\nHypomagnesaemia\nDigoxin toxicity\nMyocardial ischaemia",

Common causes include:\nDigoxin toxicity (= the classic cause of AJR)\nBeta-agonists, e.g. isoprenaline, adrenaline\nMyocardial ischaemia\nMyocarditis\nCardiac surgery\n\nTerminology\nJunctional rhythms are arbitrarily classified by their rate :\nJunctional bradycardia: < 40 bpm\nJunctional Escape Rhythm: 40-60 bpm\nAccelerated Junctional Rhythm: 60-100 bpm\nJunctional Tachycardia: > 100 bpm\n\nThey may also be classified by aetiology :\nAutomatic Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AJR) = Due to enhanced automaticity in AV nodal cells\nRe-entrant Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AVNRT ) = Due to re-entrant loop involving AV node\n\n\n\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of AJR\nRapid AJR may be difficult to distinguish from re-entrant junctional tachycardias such as AVNRT or AVRT .\nIrregularity of rhythm and heart-rate variability are suggestive of automatic junctional tachycardia\nAutomatic junctional tachycardia is typically non-responsive to vagal manoeuvres — there may be some transient slowing of the ventricular rate but reversion to sinus rhythm will not occur\n\nNOTE : AJR with aberrant conduction may be difficult to distinguish from accelerated idioventricular rhythm . The presence of fusion or capture beats indicates a ventricular rather than junctional focus.",

  "AV block: 3rd degree (complete heart block)": "ECG features of complete heart block\nSevere bradycardia due to absence of AV conduction\nThe ECG demonstrates complete AV dissociation , with independent atrial and ventricular rates\n\nIn complete heart block, there is complete absence of AV conduction, with none of the supraventricular impulses conducted to the ventricles. The perfusing rhythm is maintained by junctional or ventricular escape rhythm. Alternatively, the patient may suffer ventricular standstill leading to syncope (if self-terminating) or sudden cardiac death (if prolonged).\n\nPathophysiology\nComplete heart block is essentially the end point of either Mobitz I or Mobitz II AV block\nIt may be due to progressive fatigue of AV nodal cells as per Mobitz I (e.g. secondary to increased vagal tone in the acute phase of an inferior MI)\nAlternatively, it may be due to sudden onset of complete conduction failure throughout the His-Purkinje system, as per Mobitz II . This can be secondary to septal infarction in acute anterior MI, or as a result of progression of conducting system disease causing true trifascicular block\nThe former is more likely to respond to atropine and has a better overall prognosis\n\nCauses of complete heart block\nThe causes are the same as for Mobitz I and Mobitz II second degree heart block. The most important aetiologies are:\nInferior myocardial infarction\nAV-nodal blocking drugs (e.g. calcium-channel blockers , beta-blockers , digoxin )\nIdiopathic degeneration of the conducting system (Lenegre’s or Lev’s disease), causing true trifascicular block\n\nClinical significance\nPatients with third degree heart block are at high risk of ventricular standstill and sudden cardiac death\nThey require urgent admission for cardiac monitoring, backup temporary pacing and usually insertion of a permanent pacemaker\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nComplete heart block should not be confused with:\nHigh grade AV block : A type of severe second degree heart block with a very slow ventricular rate but still some evidence of occasional AV conduction\nAV dissociation : This term indicates only the occurrence of independent atrial and ventricular contractions and may be caused by entities other than complete heart block (e.g. “interference-dissociation” due to the presence of a ventricular rhythm such as AIVR or VT )",
  "AVNRT (AV-nodal re-entry tachycardia)": "Definition\nThe term supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to any tachydysrhythmia arising from above the level of the Bundle of His, and encompasses regular atrial, irregular atrial, and regular atrioventricular tachycardias\nIt is often used synonymously with AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) , a form of SVT\nIn the absence of aberrant conduction (e.g. bundle branch block), the ECG will demonstrate a narrow complex tachycardia\nParoxysmal SVT (pSVT) describes an SVT with abrupt onset and offset – characteristically seen with re-entrant tachycardias involving the AV node such as AVNRT or atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT)\n\nClassification\nSVTs can be classified based on: Site of origin (atria or AV node) or; Regularity (regular or irregular)\nClassification based on QRS width is unhelpful as this is also influenced by the presence of pre-existing bundle branch block, rate-related aberrant conduction, or presence of accessory pathways.\n\nClassification of SVT by site of origin and regularity\nSinus tachycardia\nAtrial tachycardia\nAtrial flutter\nInappropriate sinus tachycardia\nSinus node reentrant tachycardia\nRegular Atrioventricular\nAVRT\nAVNRT\nAutomatic junctional tachycardia\n\nAV Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia (AVNRT)\nThis is the commonest cause of palpitations in patients with structurally normal hearts\nAVNRT is typically paroxysmal and may occur spontaneously or upon provocation with exertion, caffeine, alcohol, beta-agonists (salbutamol) or sympathomimetics (amphetamines)\nIt is more common in women than men (~ 75% of cases occurring in women) and may occur in young and healthy patients as well as those suffering chronic heart disease\nPatients will typically complain of the sudden onset of rapid, regular palpitations. Other associated symptoms may include: Presyncope or syncope due to a transient fall in blood pressure Chest pain, especially in the context of underlying coronary artery disease Dyspnoea Anxiety Rarely, polyuria due to elevated atrial pressures causing release of atrial natriuretic peptide\nThe tachycardia typically ranges between 140-280 bpm and is regular in nature. It may self-resolve or continue indefinitely until medical treatment is sought\nThe condition is generally well tolerated and is rarely life threatening in patients with pre-existing heart disease\nPathophysiology\nIn comparison to AVRT , which involves an anatomical re-entry circuit (Bundle of Kent), in AVNRT there is a functional re-entry circuit within the AV node.\n\nAlrternate re-entry loops: Functional circuit in AVNRT (left), anatomical circuit in AVRT (right)\n\nFunctional pathways within the AV node\nThere are two pathways within the AV node:\nThe slow pathway ( alpha ): a slowly-conducting pathway with a short refractory period.\nThe fast pathway ( beta ): a rapidly-conducting pathway with a long refractory period.\n\nInitiation of re-entry\nDuring normal sinus rhythm, electrical impulses travel down both pathways simultaneously. The impulse transmitted down the fast pathway enters the distal end of the slow pathway and the two impulses cancel each other out\nHowever, if a premature atrial contraction (PAC) arrives while the fast pathway is still refractory, the electrical impulse will be directed solely down the slow pathway (1)\nBy the time the premature impulse reaches the end of the slow pathway, the fast pathway is no longer refractory, and the impulse is permitted to recycle retrogradely up the fast pathway (2)\nThis creates a circus movement whereby the impulse continually cycles around the two pathways, activating the Bundle of His anterogradely and the atria retrogradely (3)\nThe short cycle length is responsible for the rapid heart rate\nThis most common type of re-entrant circuit is termed Slow-Fast AVNRT\nSimilar mechanisms exist for the other types of AVNRT\nElectrocardiographic Features\nECG features of AVNRT\nRegular tachycardia ~140-280 bpm\nNarrow QRS complexes (< 120ms) unless there is co-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction\nP waves if visible exhibit retrograde conduction with P-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF.

  "AVRT (atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia)": "This page covers the pathophysiology and ECG features of pre-excitation syndromes in sinus rhythm. The two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur due to accessory pathways are discussed separately — see atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT) and atrial fibrillation/flutter in pre-excitation .\n\nOverview of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome\nWPW Syndrome refers to the presence of a congenital accessory pathway (AP) and episodes of tachyarrhythmias. The term is often used interchangeablely with pre-excitation syndrome\nFirst described in 1930 by Louis Wolff , John Parkinson and Paul Dudley White\nIncidence is 0.1 – 3.0 per 1000\nAssociated with a small risk of sudden cardiac death\n\nECG features of WPW in sinus rhythm\nPR interval < 120ms\nDelta wave : slurring slow rise of initial portion of the QRS\nQRS prolongation > 110ms\nDiscordant ST-segment and T-wave changes (i.e. in the opposite direction to the major component of the QRS complex)\nPseudo-infarction pattern in up to 70% of patients — due to negatively deflected delta waves in inferior/anterior leads (“pseudo-Q waves”), or prominent R waves in V1-3 (mimicking posterior infarction)\n\n\nAberrant conduction via an AP leads to early ventricular depolarisation (pre-excitation), which manifests as a short PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex\nConduction still occurs via the AV node, and is actually a brake on AP conduction, ceasing its propagation path in the ventricle\nQRS duration is thus prolonged, but not to the same extent as in bundle branch block\nBecause there is an initial abnormal direction of depolarisation (e.g. originating from left ventricle in left-sided AP), there will be an abnormal direction of repolarisation. This produces appropriately discordant ST segment and T wave changes (see above diagram)\n\nPathophysiology of pre-excitation and APs\nPre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an AP. Also known as bypass tracts, APs are abnormal conduction pathways formed during cardiac development and can exist in a variety of anatomical locations and in some patients there may be multiple pathways. In WPW, the AP is sometimes referred to as the Bundle of Kent , or atrioventricular bypass tract.\n\nAn AP can conduct impulses in three ways:\nIn both directions (majority)\nRetrograde only , away from the ventricle (15%)\nAnterograde only , towards the ventricle (rare)\nThe direction of conduction affects the appearance of the ECG in sinus rhythm and during tachyarrhythmias.\nAPs can be left-sided or right-sided , and ECG features will vary depending on this:\nLeft-sided AP: produces a positive delta wave in all precordial leads, with R/S > 1 in V 1 . Sometimes referred to as a type A WPW pattern\nRight-sided AP: produces a negative delta wave in leads V 1 and V 2 . Sometimes referred to as a type B WPW pattern\nNote that the features of pre-excitation may be subtle, or present only intermittently. Pre-excitation may be more pronounced with increased vagal tone e.g. during Valsalva manoeuvres, or with AV blockade e.g. drug therapy.\n\nConcealed pathway\nIn patients with retrograde-only accessory conduction, all anterograde conduction occurs via the AV node. No pre-excitation occurs and therefore no features of WPW are seen on the ECG in sinus rhythm. This is termed a “concealed pathway”. These patients can still experience tachyarrhythmias, as the pathway can still form part of a re-entry circuit.\n\nTachyarrhythmias in WPW\nThere are only two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur in patients with WPW — these are discussed separately:\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter . Due to direct conduction from atria to ventricles via an AP, bypassing the AV node\nAtrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT). Due to formation of a re-entry circuit involving the AP\n\n\nOther Pre-Excitation Syndromes / Accessory Pathways\nLown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) Syndrome\nProposed pre-excitation syndrome.

Existence is disputed.\n\nMahaim-Type Pre-excitation\nRight sided APs connecting either AV node to ventricles, fascicles to ventricles, or atria to fascicles.\nECG features:\nSinus rhythm ECG may be normal\nMay result in variation in ventricular morphology\nRe-entry tachycardia typically has LBBB morphology",
  "Axis Interpretation": "Cardiac axis represents the sum of depolarisation vectors generated by individual cardiac myocytes. Clinically is is reflected by the ventricular axis, and interpretation relies on determining the relationship between the QRS axis and limb leads of the ECG (below diagram)\nSince the left ventricle makes up most of the heart muscle under normal circumstances, normal cardiac axis is directed downward and slightly to the left:\nNormal Axis = QRS axis between -30° and +90°.\nAbnormal axis deviation, indicating underlying pathology, is demonstrated by:\nLeft Axis Deviation = QRS axis less than -30°.\nRight Axis Deviation = QRS axis greater than +90°.\nExtreme Axis Deviation = QRS axis between -90° and 180° (AKA “Northwest Axis”).\n\nNote that in paediatric ECG interpretation , the cardiac axis lies between +30 to +190 degrees at birth and moves leftward with age .\n\n\nMethods of ECG Axis Interpretation\nThere are several complementary approaches to estimating QRS axis, which are summarized below:\nThe Quadrant Method – (Lead I and aVF)\nThree Lead analysis – (Lead I, Lead II and aVF)\nIsoelectric Lead analysis\nSuper SAM the Axis Man\n\nMethod 1 – The Quadrant Method\nThe most efficient way to estimate axis is to look at LEAD I and LEAD aVF .\nExamine the QRS complex in each lead and determine if it is Positive, Isoelectric (Equiphasic) or Negative:\n\nA positive QRS in Lead I puts the axis in roughly the same direction as lead I.\nA positive QRS in Lead aVF similarly aligns the axis with lead aVF.\nCombining both coloured areas – the quadrant of overlap determines the axis. So If Lead I and aVF are both positive , the axis is between 0° and +90° (i.e. normal axis).\n\n\nNow estimate the AXIS using the Lead I and aVF – Quadrant Method:\nAXIS: QRS Positive Lead I – QRS Negative Lead aVF\nAXIS: QRS Negative Lead I – QRS Positive Lead aVF\n\n\nSummary Table:\n\nNote: **Possible LAD can be further evaluated using Lead II as detailed in method 2 below…\n\nMethod 2: Three Lead analysis – (Lead I, Lead II and aVF)\nNext we add in Lead II to the analysis of Lead I and aVF\nA positive QRS in Lead I puts the axis in roughly the same direction as lead I.\nA positive QRS in Lead II similarly aligns the axis with lead II.\nWe can then combine both coloured areas and the area of overlap determines the axis. So If Lead I and II are both positive , the axis is between -30° and +90° (i.e. normal axis).\n\nThe combined evaluation of Lead I, Lead II and aVF – allows rapid and accurate QRS assessment. The addition of Lead II can help determine pathological LAD from normal axis/physiological LAD\nNote: Lead III or aVF can both be used in three lead analysis\n\n\nNow estimate the AXIS using Three Lead analysis:\nQRS Positive Lead I – QRS Equiphasic Lead II – QRS Negative Lead aVF\nQRS Positive Lead I – QRS Negative Lead II – QRS Negative Lead aVF\nQRS Negative Lead I – QRS Positive Lead II – QRS Positive Lead aVF\n\n\nSummary Table:\n\n\nMethod 3 – The Isoelectric Lead\nThis method allows a more precise estimation of QRS axis, using the axis diagram below.\n\nKey Principles\nIf the QRS is POSITIVE in any given lead, the axis points in roughly the same direction as this lead.\nIf the QRS is NEGATIVE in any given lead, the axis points in roughly the opposite direction to this lead.\nIf the QRS is ISOELECTRIC (equiphasic) in any given lead ( positive deflection = negative deflection ), the axis is at 90° to this lead.\nStep 1: Find the isoelectric lead. The isoelectric (equiphasic) lead is the frontal lead with zero net amplitude . This can be either:\nA biphasic QRS where R wave height = Q or S wave depth.\nA flat-line QRS with no discernible features.\nStep 2: Find the positive leads.\nLook for the leads with the tallest R waves (or largest R/S ratios)\nStep 3: Calculate the QRS axis.\nThe QRS axis is at 90° to the isoelectric lead, pointing in the direction of the positive leads.\nThis concept can be difficult to understand at first, and is best illustrated by some examples.",

However, clinically the term bifascicular block is reserved for RBBB with either LAFB or LPFB\n\nElectrophysiology\nBifascicular block involves conduction delay below the atrioventricular node in two of the three fascicles:\nConduction to the ventricles is via the single remaining fascicle\nThe ECG will show typical features of RBBB plus either left or right axis deviation.\nRBBB + LAFB is the most common of the two patterns. This is due to a single coronary artery blood supply (LAD) to the anterior fascicle\nRBBB + LPFB is less common due to a dual blood supply (right and left circumflex arteries), and this combination may be associated with more extensive underlying cardiac pathology\n\n\n\nClinical significance\nBifascicular block is often associated with structural heart disease (50-80%) and extensive fibrosis of the conducting system. There is a risk of progression to complete heart block with additional damage to the third remaining fascicle, however clinical context is important:\nOverall rate of progression to complete heart block is 1-4% per year\nIn symptom free patients, these figures are ~1% per year\nPatients presenting with syncope have a 17% annual risk of progression\nSyncope or presyncope in the context of a bifascicular block is an indication for admission and monitoring. If other causes of syncope are not identified on work-up, pacemaker insertion is recommended\n\nMain Causes of Bifascicular Block\nCauses are similiar to those of RBBB and LAFB/LPFB:\nIschaemic heart disease (40-60% cases)\nStructural heart disease (50-80% association)\nAortic stenosis\nAnterior MI (occurs in 5-7% of acute AMI)\nLenègre-Lev disease\nCongenital heart disease\nHyperkalaemia (resolves with treatment)\nA new-onset bifascicular block in the context of chest pain is highly associated with proximal LAD occlusion, even in the absence of ST-segment changes. In 30% of cases, patients present with no ST elevation and bifascicular block is the only acute ECG finding.\n\nDifferential diagnosis\nMasquerading Bundle Branch Block (MBBB) presents with a mixed complete RBBB and complete LBBB pattern similar to a typical bifascicular block pattern. This rare ECG pattern indicates more extensive fibrosis of the conducting system and limited studies demonstrate a poorer prognosis and higher progression to complete heart block\nIn the context of RBBB, RAD indicating LPFB may be due to other causes such as right ventricular hypertrophy , and these need to be excluded before the ECG is labelled bifascicular block",
  "Biventricular enlargement": "Biventricular Hypertrophy\nHypertrophy of both the left and right ventricles.\nThe ECG has a low sensitivity for the diagnosis of biventricular hypertrophy (BVH), as the opposing left and right ventricular forces tend to cancel each other out.\nThere may be signs of both Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ( LVH ) and Right Ventricular Hypertrophy ( RVH) on the same ECG – e.g. positive diagnostic criteria for LVH with some additional features suggestive of RVH.\nThe Katz-Wachtel phenomenon – large biphasic QRS complexes in V2-5.

  "Brugada syndrome": "Brugada Syndrome History\nBrugada Syndrome is a cardiac abnormality with a high incidence of sudden death in patients with structurally normal hearts.\nFirst described in 1992 by the Brugada brothers, the disease has since had an exponential rise in the numbers of cases reported. The mean age of sudden death is 41, with the age at diagnosis ranging from 2 days to 84 years.\nIncidence is high in Southeast Asia where it had been previously described as Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome (SUNDS).\nPreviously known colloquially in the Philippines as bangungut (‘to rise and moan in sleep’); in Japan as pokkuri (‘sudden and unexpectedly ceased phenomena’) and in Thailand as Lai Tai (‘death during sleep’).\nBrugada Syndrome Key Points\nThere’s really only one type of Brugada syndrome.\nDiagnosis depends on a characteristic ECG finding AND clinical criteria.\nFurther risk stratification is controversial.\nDefinitive treatment = ICD.\nBrugada sign in isolation is of questionable significance.\n\nAetiology of Brugada Syndrome\nIn a nutshell, Brugada syndrome is due to a mutation in the cardiac sodium channel gene. This is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy. Over 60 different mutations have been described so far and at least 50% are spontaneous mutations, but familial clustering and autosomal dominant inheritance has been demonstrated.\nECG changes can be transient with Brugada syndrome and can also be unmasked or augmented by multiple factors:\nFever\nIschaemia\nMultiple Drugs Sodium channel blockers eg: Flecainide, Propafenone Calcium channel blockers Alpha agonists Beta Blockers Nitrates Cholinergic stimulation Cocaine Alcohol\nHypokalaemia\nHyperkalaemia\nHypothermia\nPost DC cardioversion\nDiagnostic Criteria\nType 1\nCoved ST segment elevation >2mm in >1 of V1-V3 followed by a negative T wave.\nThis is the only ECG abnormality that is potentially diagnostic.\nIt is often referred to as Brugada sign .\n\nThis ECG abnormality must be associated with one of the following clinical criteria to make the diagnosis:\nDocumented ventricular fibrillation (VF) or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT).\nFamily history of sudden cardiac death at <45 years old .\nCoved-type ECGs in family members.\nInducibility of VT with programmed electrical stimulation .\nSyncope.\nNocturnal agonal respiration.\n\nThe other two types of Brugada are non-diagnostic but possibly warrant further investigation (see discussion below).\nType 2\nBrugada Type 2 has >2mm of saddleback shaped ST elevation.\n\nType 3\nBrugada type 3: can be the morphology of either type 1 or type 2, but with <2mm of ST segment elevation.\n\nManagement\nThe only proven therapy is an implantable cardioverter – defibrillator (ICD). Quinidine has been proposed as an alternative in settings where ICD’s are unavailable or where they would be inappropriate (eg: neonates).\nUndiagnosed, Brugada syndrome has been estimated to have a mortality of 10% per year. Does this mean that a diagnosis in ED mandates admission? Probably yes for all type 1 patients if they present with suggestive clinical criteria.\nIt may be appropriate for risk stratification on an outpatient basis with an electrophysiology study (EPS) to see if the patient has inducible ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF)in the following settings:\nAsymptomatic patients with a type 1 ECG pattern.\nAll type 2 + 3 ECG patterns.\nHowever this is controversial with much debate in the literature ranging from a very low threshold for EPS studies and ICD insertion (Brugada et al) to more conservative approaches. One of the problems is that EPS are far from a gold standard, with a negative predictive value of less than 50% and some studies suggest that we might be getting a little over-excited about this relatively recently described ECG finding.\nAdmittedly study sizes are pretty small – but one study followed 98 asymptomatic Japanese patients with ‘Brugada sign’ on routine ECG for 7.8 years and found them to have no greater mortality than the rest of a 14000 strong cohort. This highlights the importance of the clinical criteria required for diagnosis listed above.\nPharmacological assessment has been suggested by some in Type 2 + 3 patterns, if Brugada syndrome is suspected clinically – the administration of sodium channel blocking drugs may convert these non-diagnostic forms into the diagnostic type 1, however the sensitivity of this test is unknown and it would appear that this subgroup is at extremely low / no increased mortality when compared to the general population.",
  "Bundgaard syndrome": "Description\nBundgaard et al introduced us in 2018 to “Familial ST-segment depression syndrome”, a new cardiac arrhythmia syndrome predisposing to atrial fibrillation, VT, and sudden cardiac death.\nECGs reviewed from five unrelated families demonstrated a consistent pattern of widespread, concave-upward ST depression, in the absence of coronary artery disease or ischaemia. In contrast to other genetic disorders such as Brugada syndrome and LQTS, these changes remain stable over time, only accentuated by exercise.\nAffected individuals had varying time courses of disease, but usually remained asymptomatic until the onset of tachyarrhythmias, often initially atrial fibrillation with subsequent episodes of VT/VF leading to sudden cardiac death.\nDiagnosing “Familial ST-segment depression syndrome”\nUnexplained concave-upward ST depression in at least 7 leads, 90ms after J point ST elevation in lead aVR > 0.1mV ECG findings are persistent with time Autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance\nThe authors proposed the above diagnostic criteria, with “unexplained” highlighting the importance that ischaemia, structural heart disease and metabolic abnormalities have been excluded prior to labelling the condition.\nOther secondary diagnostic features were accentuation seen with exercise in some, and the presence of a notch in the ascending part of the ST segment. Note that onset of complications do not appear to correlate with age based on limited observations of affected individuals.\n\n(A) concave-upward ST-segment depression in leads I, II, aVL, aVF, V2-V6,\n(B) ST-segment elevation in lead aVR.\n(C) A notch is visible in the ascending part of the ST segment of the precordial leads, most prominent in leads V3-V4\n\nClinical significance: Doesn’t that look familiar?\nThe pattern of “diffuse ST depression with coexistent ST elevation in lead aVR” would be familiar to many of us. In the acute chest pain presentation it raises concern for LMCA insufficiency causing severe ischaemia. Although this pattern is no longer thought to be an indicator of acute occlusion, these NOMI patients should undergo urgent catherisation following medical therapy\nPatients with Familial ST-segment Depression Syndrome presenting with chest pain may be mistakenly identified as suffering from an acute ischaemic event. Subsequent unremarkable laboratory and angiography findings, in combination with the “static” nature of this pattern, should raise concern for FSDS and prompt further investigation and screening of family members\nGenetic testing for cardiovascular disorders in affected individuals was negative and to date a causative genetic sequence is yet to be identified",

Inheritance is primarily autosomal dominant, with variable penetrance. Over 150 mutations have been identified, explaining the variability in the clinical phenotype.\n\nStructural changes\nThe chief abnormality associated with HCM is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), occurring in the absence of any inciting stimulus such as hypertension or aortic stenosis\nThe degree and distribution of LVH is variable: mild hypertrophy (13-15 mm) or extreme myocardial thickening (30-60 mm) may be seen.\nThe most commonly observed pattern is asymmetrical thickening of the anterior interventricular septum (= asymmetrical septal hypertrophy ). This pattern has been classically associated with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction\nHowever, in the majority of cases (75%), HCM is not associated with LVOT obstruction, hence the name change from HOCM to HCM\nOther less common patterns of LVH include concentric hypertrophy (20% of cases) and apical hypertrophy (10%)\n\nPathophysiology of clinical manifestations\nProcesses responsible for clinical manifestations of HCM:\nDynamic obstruction of the LVOT\nLeft ventricular diastolic dysfunction, resulting from impaired relaxation and filling of the stiff and hypertrophied left ventricle (often associated with increased filling pressures)\nAbnormal intramural coronary arteries with thickened walls and narrowed lumens\nChaotic, disorganised left ventricular architecture (“cellular disarray”) predisposing to abnormal transmission of electrical impulses, thus serving as a substrate for arrhythmogenesis\n\nClinical features\nExertional syncope or pre-syncope — this is the most worrying symptom, suggesting dynamic LVOT obstruction ± ventricular dysrhythmia, with the potential for sudden cardiac death\nSymptoms of pulmonary congestion (e.g. exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) due to left ventricular dysfunction\nChest pain — may be typical anginal pain due to increased demand (thicker myocardial walls) and reduced supply (aberrant coronary arteries)\nPalpitations due to supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias\n\nApical HCM\nThis relatively uncommon form of HCM is seen most frequently in Japanese patients (13-25% of all HCM cases in Japan)\nThere is localised hypertrophy of LV apex, causing a “spade-shaped” configuration of the LV cavity on ventriculography\nThe classic ECG finding in apical HCM is giant T-wave inversion in the precordial leads\n\n\nUseful Tip\nThere is a small subset of patients with HCM who will have an abnormal ECG with no evidence of LVH on echo\nIf there is clinical concern for HCM — i.e. syncope, chest pain and characteristic ECG changes — patients should be referred for a cardiac MRI if echo is unremarkable",

  "Ectopic atrial tachycardia": "Definition\nFocal atrial tachycardia (FAT) is a form of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) originating from a single ectopic focus within the atria but outside of the sinus node\n\nThe term FAT is commonly used synonymously with atrial tachycardia, a broader term referring to any form of SVT originating within the atria but outside of the sinus node\nFAT, atrial flutter and multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) are all forms of atrial tachycardia\nManagement of the three types varies and thus distinguishing between them is clinically important\n\nPathophysiology of FAT\nDue to a single ectopic focus\nThe underlying mechanism can involve increased automaticity, triggered activity or reentry\nMay be paroxysmal or sustained\nMultiple causes including: Digoxin toxicity Atrial scarring due to ischaemic heart disease Catecholamine excess Stimulants including cocaine, caffeine Alcohol Congenital abnormalities Idiopathic\nSustained atrial tachycardia may rarely be seen and can progress to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy\n\nECG Features of Atrial Tachycardia\nAtrial rate > 100 bpm\nAbnormal P wave morphology and axis (e.g. inverted in inferior leads) due to ectopic origin\nUnifocal, identical P waves\nIsoelectric baseline (unlike atrial flutter )\nNormal QRS morphology (unless pre-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction)\nAV block may be present — this is generally a physiological response to the rapid atrial rate, except in digoxin toxicity where there is AV nodal suppression due to vagotonic effects of digoxin, resulting in a slow ventricular rate ( “PAT with block” ).",

  "Emphysema": "Common ECG findings in COPD\nRightward deviation of the P wave and QRS axis\nLow voltage QRS complexes, especially in the left precordial leads (V4-6)\nWith development of cor pulmonale, right atrial enlargement (P pulmonale) and right ventricular hypertrophy\nArrhythmias including multifocal atrial tachycardia\n\nECG changes occur in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) due to:\nThe presence of hyperexpanded emphysematous lungs within the chest\nThe long-term effects of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction upon the right side of the heart, causing pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy (i.e. cor pulmonale)\n\nEffects of Emphysema on the Heart\nLung hyperexpansion causes external compression of the heart and lowering of the diaphragm, with consequent elongation and vertical orientation of the heart\nDue to its fixed attachments to the great vessels, the heart undergoes clockwise rotation in the transverse plane, with movement of the right ventricle anteriorly and displacement of the left ventricle posteriorly\nThe presence of increased air between the heart and recording electrodes has a dampening effect, leading to reduced amplitude of the QRS complexes\n\n\nEffects on the pulmonary vasculature\nChronic hypoxaemia causes reflex vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arterioles (“hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction”), with consequent elevation of pulmonary arterial pressures\nDestruction of lung tissue with loss of pulmonary capillaries increases the resistance of the pulmonary vascular bed by reducing its effective surface area\nOver time, this chronic elevation of pulmonary arterial pressures results in compensatory right atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy\n\nTypical ECG Findings in COPD\n1. The most typical ECG findings in emphysema are:\nRightward shift of the P wave axis with prominent P waves in the inferior leads and flattened or inverted P waves in leads I and aVL\nRightward shift of the QRS axis towards +90 degrees (vertical axis) or beyond ( right axis deviation )\nExaggerated atrial depolarisation causing PR and ST segments that “sag” below the TP baseline\nLow voltage QRS complexes , especially in the left precordial leads (V4-6)\nClockwise rotation of the heart with delayed R/S transition point in the precordial leads +/- persistent S wave in V6.

  "Epsilon wave": "Epsilon Wave Definition\nSmall deflection (“blip” or “wiggle”) buried in the end of the QRS complex\nOn Standard 12-lead ECG (S-ECG), best seen in ST segment of V1 and V2, they are usually present in leads V1 through V4\nCaused by post-excitation of myocytes in the right ventricle\nCharacteristic finding in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)\n\nEpsilon waves are the most specific and characteristic finding in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). In ARVD, myocytes are replaced by fat, producing islands of viable myocytes in a sea of fat. This causes a delay in excitation of some of the myocytes of the right ventricle, producing a small “blip” seen during the ST segment of the ECG.\nEpsilon waves have also been described in patients with:\nPosterior myocardial infarction\nRight ventricular infarction\nInfiltrative disease\nSarcoidosis",

First described as a unique electrophysiologic entity in 1981 by Belhassen et al [Belhassen VT; fascicular or intrafascicular tachycardia; or verapamil sensitive VT; narrow complex VT]\n\nCauses\nUsually occurs in young healthy patients (15-40 years of age; 60-80% male). Most episodes occur at rest but may be triggered by exercise, stress and beta agonists. The mechanism is re-entrant tachycardia due to an ectopic focus within the left ventricle.\nNB. A similar ECG pattern of fascicular VT may occur with digoxin toxicity , but here the mechanism is enhanced automaticity in the region of the fascicles.\n\nClassification\nFascicular tachycardia can be classified based on ECG morphology corresponding to the anatomical location of the re-entry circuit:\n\n\nDiagnosis and Management\nDiagnosis can be difficult and this rhythm is often misdiagnosed as SVT with RBBB; the diagnosis is made by observing specific features of VT, e.g. fusion/capture beats, AV dissociation.\nIdiopathic fascicular tachycardia may prove difficult to treat as it is often unresponsive to adensoine, vagal maneouvers, and lignocaine. However, it characteristically responds to verapamil\nDigoxin-induced fascicular VT is responsive to Digoxin Immune Fab",
  "Fusion beats": "Fusion Beats\nA fusion beat occurs when a supraventricular and a ventricular impulse coincide to produce a hybrid complex. It indicates that there are two foci of pacemaker cells firing simultaneously: a supraventricular pacemaker (e.g. the sinus node) and a competing ventricular pacemaker (source of ventricular ectopics).\nThe fusion beats are of intermediate width and morphology to the supraventricular and ventricular complexes.\nOriginally described by William Dressler in 1952",
  "High take-off": "Benign early repolarisation (BER) is a usually benign ECG pattern producing widespread ST segment elevation that is commonly seen in young, healthy patients < 50 years of age. Also known as “high take-off” or “J-point elevation”, it may mimic pericarditis or acute MI.\nECG Features\nWidespread concave ST elevation, most prominent in the mid-to-left precordial leads (V2-5)\nNotching or slurring at the J point\nProminent, slightly asymmetrical T waves that are concordant with the QRS complex\nST elevation : T wave height ratio in V6 < 0.25 (see below)\nNo reciprocal ST depression to suggest Occlusion MI\n\nClinical Relevance\nWidespread ST elevation in BER may mimic pericarditis or acute MI\nUp to 10-15% of ED patients presenting with chest pain will have BER on their ECG, making it a common diagnostic challenge for clinicians. BER is less common in patients over 50, and particularly rare in those over 70, wherein ST elevation is more likely to represent myocardial ischaemia\nThe physiological basis of BER is poorly understood. It is generally thought to be a normal variant that is not indicative of underlying cardiac disease, but recently a link has been made between the global BER pattern and future risk of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF)\nAvoid diagnosing BER in patients over the age of 50, especially those with risk factors for ischaemic heart disease.\n\nST segment / T wave morphology\nThe ST segment-T wave complex in BER has a characteristic appearance:\nThere is elevation of the J point\nThe T wave is peaked and slightly asymmetrical\nThe ST segment and the ascending limb of the T wave form an upward concavity\nThe descending limb of the T wave is straighter and slightly steeper than the ascending limb\nThe concept of “smiley-shaped” ST elevation, popularized by Ken Grauer in 1993 , is worthy of mention:\n\nTypical morphology of BER\n\n\n\nJ-point morphology\nOne characteristic feature of BER is the presence of a notched or irregular J point : the so-called “ fish hook” pattern .

  "Hyperkalaemia": "Hyperkalaemia is defined as a serum potassium level of > 5.2 mmol/L. ECG changes generally do not manifest until there is a moderate degree of hyperkalaemia (≥ 6.0 mmol/L). The earliest manifestation of hyperkalaemia is an increase in T wave amplitude.\nECG features of hyperkalaemia\nPeaked T waves\nP wave widening/flattening, PR prolongation\nBradyarrhythmias: sinus bradycardia, high-grade AV block with slow junctional and ventricular escape rhythms, slow AF\nConduction blocks (bundle branch block, fascicular blocks)\nQRS widening with bizarre QRS morphology\nWith worsening hyperkalaemia… (> 9.0 mmol/L):\nDevelopment of sine wave appearance (pre-terminal rhythm)\nVentricular fibrillation\nPEA with bizarre, wide complex rhythm\nAsystole\nNote: Serum potassium level may not correlate closely with ECG changes. Patients with a relatively normal ECG can suffer sudden hyperkalaemia cardiac arrest. In any patient who has suffered a bradycardia PEA arrest, suspect and treat for hyperkalaemia.\n\n\nAn easy way to remember the usual order of ECG changes seen is by following the ECG trace logically – effects begin on the T wave and move forwards to the P wave / PR interval, and subsequently to the QRS complex with QRS widening and conduction blocks.\n\nThe push-pull effect\n\nHypokalaemia creates the illusion that the T wave is “pushed down”, with resultant T-wave flattening/inversion, ST depression, and prominent U waves\nIn hyperkalaemia, the T wave is “pulled upwards”, creating tall “tented” T waves, and stretching the remainder of the ECG to cause P wave flattening, PR prolongation, and QRS widening\n\nPathophysiology\nPotassium is vital for regulating the normal electrical activity of the heart. Increased extracellular potassium reduces myocardial excitability, with depression of both pacemaking and conducting tissues.\nProgressively worsening hyperkalaemia leads to suppression of impulse generation by the SA node and reduced conduction by the AV node and His-Purkinje system, resulting in bradycardia and conduction blocks and ultimately cardiac arrest.\n\n\nHandy Tips\nSuspect hyperkalaemia in any patient with a new bradyarrhythmia or AV block, especially patients with renal failure, on haemodialysis, or taking any combination of ACE inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics and potassium supplements.\nFor an excellent review of the management of hyperkalaemia, check out this podcast by Scott Weingart.",

Atrial fibrillation is seen in up to 20% of patients. Severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) may present with atrial tachycardias at rates > 200 bpm.\n\nMechanism\nThe ECG changes in thyrotoxicosis are principally related to increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the stimulatory effects of thyroid hormone on the myocardium.\nAtrial tissue is very sensitive to the effects of thyroid hormone, hence the preponderance of atrial tachydysrhythmias.\n\nUseful Tips\nPatients with unexplained sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation should have their TSH and T4 checked to look for evidence of thyrotoxicosis.\nThyrotoxic atrial tachydysrhythmias are treated with intravenous beta-blockers (e.g. titrated IV boluses of propranolol or an esmolol infusion).",

Inheritance is primarily autosomal dominant, with variable penetrance. Over 150 mutations have been identified, explaining the variability in the clinical phenotype.\n\nStructural changes\nThe chief abnormality associated with HCM is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), occurring in the absence of any inciting stimulus such as hypertension or aortic stenosis\nThe degree and distribution of LVH is variable: mild hypertrophy (13-15 mm) or extreme myocardial thickening (30-60 mm) may be seen.\nThe most commonly observed pattern is asymmetrical thickening of the anterior interventricular septum (= asymmetrical septal hypertrophy ). This pattern has been classically associated with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve and dynamic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction\nHowever, in the majority of cases (75%), HCM is not associated with LVOT obstruction, hence the name change from HOCM to HCM\nOther less common patterns of LVH include concentric hypertrophy (20% of cases) and apical hypertrophy (10%)\n\nPathophysiology of clinical manifestations\nProcesses responsible for clinical manifestations of HCM:\nDynamic obstruction of the LVOT\nLeft ventricular diastolic dysfunction, resulting from impaired relaxation and filling of the stiff and hypertrophied left ventricle (often associated with increased filling pressures)\nAbnormal intramural coronary arteries with thickened walls and narrowed lumens\nChaotic, disorganised left ventricular architecture (“cellular disarray”) predisposing to abnormal transmission of electrical impulses, thus serving as a substrate for arrhythmogenesis\n\nClinical features\nExertional syncope or pre-syncope — this is the most worrying symptom, suggesting dynamic LVOT obstruction ± ventricular dysrhythmia, with the potential for sudden cardiac death\nSymptoms of pulmonary congestion (e.g. exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea) due to left ventricular dysfunction\nChest pain — may be typical anginal pain due to increased demand (thicker myocardial walls) and reduced supply (aberrant coronary arteries)\nPalpitations due to supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias\n\nApical HCM\nThis relatively uncommon form of HCM is seen most frequently in Japanese patients (13-25% of all HCM cases in Japan)\nThere is localised hypertrophy of LV apex, causing a “spade-shaped” configuration of the LV cavity on ventriculography\nThe classic ECG finding in apical HCM is giant T-wave inversion in the precordial leads\n\n\nUseful Tip\nThere is a small subset of patients with HCM who will have an abnormal ECG with no evidence of LVH on echo\nIf there is clinical concern for HCM — i.e. syncope, chest pain and characteristic ECG changes — patients should be referred for a cardiac MRI if echo is unremarkable",

The attacks usually occurred following effort. Occasionally the boy had complained of palpitations and precordial pains. In July, 1953, he was examined with the only pathologic finding being a prolongation of the Q-T interval in the electrocardiogram, worse following exercise. On Nov. 19, 1953, he had a further attack.

If before, there is a short PR interval of < 120 ms and the  “ retrograde ” P waves are usually inverted in leads II, III and aVF.\nOccurs sooner than would be expected for the next sinus impulse.\nFollowed by a compensatory pause.\nPJCs that arrive early in the cycle may be conducted aberrantly, most commonly with a RBBB morphology.",

The delay between activation of the RV and LV produces the characteristic “M-shaped” R wave seen in lateral leads\nDelayed overall conduction time to the LV extends the QRS duration to ≥ 120 ms\n\n\nECG QRS Morphology\nQRS Morphology in the Lateral Leads\nThe R wave in the lateral leads may be either “M-shaped”, notched, monophasic, or an RS complex\n\n\nQRS Morphology in V1\nThe QRS complex in V1 may be either:\nrS complex (small R wave, deep S wave)\nQS complex (deep Q/S wave with no preceding R wave)\n\n\n\nWhat about the ST elevation?\nAppropriate discordance refers to the fact that abnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation, which appears discordant to the preceding QRS complex\nLateral leads with tall, broad R waves will often have associated ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion, and those with deep S waves can have an allowable amount of ST elevation that does not indicate ischaemia (generally viewed as < 25% of the size of the preceding S wave)\nAny concordant ST segment change is concerning for ischaemia.

However, more up-to-date data suggests that chest pain patients with new LBBB have little increased risk of acute myocardial infarction at the time of presentation.\nPractice has now evolved to examining for excessive discordance or concordant ST segment changes indicative of infarction.",
  "Left bundle branch block - diagnosing myocardial infarction (Sgarbossa criteria)": "Smith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria\nConcordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead\nConcordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead of V1-V3\nProportionally excessive discordant STE in ≥ 1 lead anywhere with ≥ 1 mm STE, as defined by ≥ 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave\n\nBackground\nIn patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) or ventricular paced rhythm , infarct diagnosis based on the ECG can be difficult\nAbnormal depolarisation should be followed by abnormal repolarisation, manifesting as ST-segment and T-wave deviations that do not necessarily indicate acute ischaemia (“appropriate discordance”)\n\nHowever, serial ECGs may show dynamic ST segment changes during ischaemia\nIn 1996, Elena B Sgarbossa first described criteria to assist clinicians to diagnose infarction in the setting of LBBB\n\nOriginal Sgarbossa Criteria\nThe original three criteria used to diagnose infarction in patients with LBBB are:\nConcordant ST elevation > 1mm in leads with a positive QRS complex (score 5)\nConcordant ST depression > 1 mm in V1-V3 (score 3)\nExcessively discordant ST elevation > 5 mm in leads with a -ve QRS complex (score 2)\nThese criteria are specific, but not sensitive (36%) for myocardial infarction. A total score of  ≥ 3 is reported to have a specificity of 90% for diagnosing myocardial infarction.\n\nDuring right ventricular pacing the ECG also shows left bundle brach block and the above rules also apply for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction during pacing, however they are less specific.\n\nSmith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria\nAs discussed in this article by Stephen Smith , the Smith modified Sgarbossa criteria for Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (OMI) in LBBB have been created to improve diagnostic accuracy. The most important change is the modification of the rule for excessive discordance .\nThe use of a 5 mm cutoff for excessive discordance was arbitrary and non-specific — for example, patients with LBBB and large voltages will commonly have ST deviations > 5 mm in the absence of ischaemia. The modified rule is positive for “STEMI” if there is discordant ST elevation with amplitude > 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave.\nSmith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria:\nConcordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead\nConcordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead of V1-V3\nProportionally excessive discordant STE in ≥ 1 lead anywhere with ≥ 1 mm STE, as defined by ≥ 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave\nSee the modified Sgarbossa criteria in action in this excellent case study by Stephen Smith and references for the 1) Derivation and 2) validation of the Smith-Modified criteria",
  "Left main coronary artery occlusion (ST elevation in aVR)": "Left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis\nProximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis\nSevere triple vessel disease\nHypoxia or hypotension, for example following resuscitation from cardiac arrest\nST elevation in aVR can also be seen in the context of anterior STEMI due to LAD occlusion proximal to the first septal branch, causing infarction of the basal septum. Such cases will have associated ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.\n\n\nMechanism of ST elevation (STE) in aVR\nLead aVR is electrically opposite to the left-sided leads I, II, aVL and V4-6. In the case of subendocardial ischaemia, ST elevation in aVR is simply a reciprocal change to ST depression in these leads\nST depression does not localise , and thus subendocardial ischaemia due to oxygen supply/demand mismatch produces a consistent ECG pattern of widespread ST depression, usually most prominent in leads I, II, V4-6, and reciprocal ST elevation in aVR\nLead aVR also directly records electrical activity from the right upper portion of the heart, including the right ventricular outflow tract and the basal portion of the interventricular septum. Infarction in this area could theoretically produce ST elevation in aVR\n\nCause of ST elevation (STE) in AVR\nTwo possible mechanisms:\nDiffuse subendocardial ischaemia , with widespread ST depression producing reciprocal change in aVR (most common)\nInfarction of the basal septum , i.e. a STEMI involving aVR\nThe basal septum is supplied by the first septal perforator artery (a very proximal branch of the LAD), so ischaemia / infarction of the basal septum would imply involvement of the proximal LAD.\n\nLMCA “occlusion”: a misnomer\nST elevation in aVR with coexistent multi-lead ST depression can be a sign of Non-Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (NOMI) due to severe single or multi-vessel disease, but does not usually represent acute LMCA occlusion as once thought. Such acute occlusion most often causes sudden cardiac death due to simultaneous anterior, lateral and posterior STEMI.\nMore recent publications recognise this ECG pattern as consistent with left main coronary artery subocclusion or complete occlusion with well-developed collateral circulation. A 2019 single-centre retrospective analysis identified patients presenting with STE-aVR with multilead ST depression. Coronary occlusion was found only in 10% of patients, and none of these lesions were involving the LAD or left main coronary artery\n\nPredictive Value of STE in aVR\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm indicates proximal LAD / LMCA stenosis or severe 3VD\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm predicts the need for CABG\nAbsence of ST elevation in aVR almost entirely excludes a significant LMCA lesion\n\nDeep Dive into the literature of aVR\nPopulation : 113 patients with unstable angina, including 20 patients with LMCA stenosis and 24 patients with 3VD\nFindings : Patients with LMCA or 3VD frequently demonstrated ST-segment depression in multiple leads (typically I, II  and V4-V6) plus ST-segment elevation in lead aVR during attacks of angina",

This produces small R waves in I and aVL, and small Q waves in inferior leads (II, III, aVF)\nThe major wave of depolarisation then spreads along the free LV wall in a downward and rightward direction, producing tall R waves in inferior leads and deep S waves in the lateral leads.\nThis process takes up to 20 milliseconds longer than simultaneous conduction via both fascicles, resulting in a slight widening of the QRS.\nBecause impulses reaches the inferior leads later than normal, there is an increased R wave peak time in aVF (time from onset of QRS to peak of R wave)\n\nSequence of conduction in LPFB",

  "Myocardial ischemia": "This page covers the ECG signs of myocardial ischaemia seen with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes ( NSTEACS ). ST-elevation and Q-wave myocardial infarction patterns are covered elsewhere: LMCA occlusion , Anterior STEMI , Lateral STEMI , Inferior STEMI , Right Ventricular Infarction , Posterior Infarction and Wellens syndrome\nMyocardial Ischaemia Background\nNon-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTEACS ) encompasses two main entities:\nNon-ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ).\nUnstable angina pectoris ( UAP ).\nThe differentiation between these two conditions is usually retrospective, based on the presence/absence of raised cardiac enzymes at 8-12 hours after the onset of chest pain.\nBoth produce the same spectrum of ECG changes and symptoms and are managed identically in the Emergency Department.\n\nPatterns of Myocardial Ischaemia\nTwo main ECG patterns associated with NSTEACS:\nST segment depression\nT wave flattening or inversion\nWhile there are numerous conditions that may simulate myocardial ischaemia (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy , digoxin effect ), dynamic ST segment and T wave changes (i.e. different from baseline ECG or changing over time) are strongly suggestive of myocardial ischaemia.\nOther ECG patterns of ischaemia\nHyperacute (peaked) T waves or pseudonormalisation of previously inverted T waves (i.e. becoming upright) suggest hyperacute STEMI .\nAnother, less well-known ECG feature of myocardial ischaemia is U-wave inversion .\n\nMorphology of ST Depression\nST depression can be either upsloping, downsloping, or horizontal (see diagram below).\nHorizontal or downsloping ST depression ≥ 0.5 mm at the J-point in ≥ 2 contiguous leads indicates myocardial ischaemia ( according to the 2007 Task Force Criteria ).\nST depression ≥ 1 mm is more specific and conveys a worse prognosis.\nST depression ≥ 2 mm in ≥ 3 leads is associated with a high probability of NSTEMI and predicts significant mortality (35% mortality at 30 days).\nUpsloping ST depression is non-specific for myocardial ischaemia.\n\nExamples of ST segment morphology in myocardial ischaemia\n\n\nDistribution of ST segment depression\nST depression due to myocardial ischaemia may be present in a variable number of leads and with variable morphology:\nST depression due to subendocardial ischaemia is usually widespread — typically present in leads I, II, V4-6 and a variable number of additional leads.\nA pattern of widespread ST depression plus ST elevation in aVR > 1 mm is suggestive of left main coronary artery occlusion .\nST depression localised to a particular territory (esp. inferior or high lateral leads only) is more likely to represent reciprocal change due to STEMI. The corresponding ST elevation may be subtle and difficult to see, but should be sought.\nThis concept of ST depression failing to localise is further discussed on Dr Smiths blog.\nWidespread subendocardial ischaemia due to LMCA occlusion\n\nT wave inversion\nT wave inversion may be considered to be evidence of myocardial ischaemia if:\nAt least 1 mm deep\nPresent in ≥ 2 continuous leads that have dominant R waves (R/S ratio > 1)\nDynamic — not present on old ECG or changing over time\nNB. T wave inversion is only significant if seen in leads with upright QRS complexes (dominant R waves). T wave inversion is a normal variant in leads III, aVR and V1.\nWidespread T wave inversion due to myocardial ischaemia (most prominent in the lateral leads)\n\nWellens Syndrome\nWellens syndrome is a pattern of inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-4 (in patients presenting with ischaemic chest pain) that is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery .\nPatients may be pain free by the time the ECG is taken and have normally or minimally elevated cardiac enzymes; however, they are at extremely high risk for extensive anterior wall MI within the next 2-3 weeks.\nThere are two patterns of T-wave abnormality in Wellens syndrome:\nType A – Biphasic, with initial positivity and terminal negativity (25% of cases) Type B – Deeply and symmetrically inverted (75% of cases)\nBiphasic T Waves (Type A)\n\n\nDeeply Inverted T Waves (Type B)\n\nNB. There is confusion in the literature regarding the naming of the T wave patterns, with some authors using Type 1 (Type A) for biphasic T waves and Type 2 (Type B) for inverted .

  "Non-paroxysmal junctional tachycardia": "Accelerated Junctional Rhythm Overview\nAccelerated junctional rhythm (AJR) occurs when the rate of an AV junctional pacemaker exceeds that of the sinus node.

Common causes include:\nDigoxin toxicity (= the classic cause of AJR)\nBeta-agonists, e.g. isoprenaline, adrenaline\nMyocardial ischaemia\nMyocarditis\nCardiac surgery\n\nTerminology\nJunctional rhythms are arbitrarily classified by their rate :\nJunctional bradycardia: < 40 bpm\nJunctional Escape Rhythm: 40-60 bpm\nAccelerated Junctional Rhythm: 60-100 bpm\nJunctional Tachycardia: > 100 bpm\n\nThey may also be classified by aetiology :\nAutomatic Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AJR) = Due to enhanced automaticity in AV nodal cells\nRe-entrant Junctional Rhythms (e.g. AVNRT ) = Due to re-entrant loop involving AV node\n\n\n\n\nDifferential Diagnosis of AJR\nRapid AJR may be difficult to distinguish from re-entrant junctional tachycardias such as AVNRT or AVRT .\nIrregularity of rhythm and heart-rate variability are suggestive of automatic junctional tachycardia\nAutomatic junctional tachycardia is typically non-responsive to vagal manoeuvres — there may be some transient slowing of the ventricular rate but reversion to sinus rhythm will not occur\n\nNOTE : AJR with aberrant conduction may be difficult to distinguish from accelerated idioventricular rhythm . The presence of fusion or capture beats indicates a ventricular rather than junctional focus.",
  "OMI: Replacing the STEMI misnomer": "In 2018, Meyers , Weingart and Smith introduced us to the concept of Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (OMI) through the OMI Manifesto . Since this, there has been gaining awareness that ST elevation on ECG is most likely an unreliable tool for detecting patients that will benefit from PCI, and that a shift is required to a more reliable paradigm for detecting acute coronary occlusion.\nWe utilise “STEMI criteria” in everyday practice but conveniently ignore the 2.5mm STE on the ECG of a 30-year-old male with benign sounding chest pain, whilst scrutinising over the trace STE in an 80-year-old female with ischaemic-sounding chest pain. The term “STEMI equivalent” is already in our vocabulary, but really it is referring to patients with clinical and ECG features concerning for acute coronary occlusion that would benefit from immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\nAustralian guidelines recommend PCI for a number of patient groups with NSTEACS, however with differing time interval guidelines, ranging from 2 to 72 hours, and arbitrary criteria. These include a recommendation for high risk groups with dynamic ST segment or T waves changes to receive intervention within 24 hours. Outside of this there is no specific recommendation as to which ECG findings are indicative of more immediate management. Those with recurrent symptoms are suggested for intervention within 72 hours by which time reversal of any acute occlusion is going to be of little benefit to infarcted tissue.\n\nThe ACCF/AHA guidelines recognise the significance of other ECG patterns in predicting occlusion, however they are yet to be incorporated into guidelines and remain “patterns to be aware of” for the practicing clinician. The publication recognises that baseline ECG abnormalities such as LV hypertrophy may obscure ECG interpretation, but does not offer a recommendation on ways to overcome this.\nWhat is an OMI?\n\nPatients with Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (OMI) are those that benefit from emergent reperfusion therapy , and in which the benefits outweigh the risks of this invasive procedure\nThere are a number of ECG patterns that can represent occlusion, these and the clinical features can be used to guide diagnosis and raise suspicion for an OMI. Some of these such as Sgarbossa criteria we may already be familiar with\nThere is no single criterion and the clinical context is an important factor. Both European and American guidelines recommend that any patient with ongoing ischaemic chest pain be considered for immediate angiography\nThe STEMI/NSTEMI paradigm is not a reliable tool for diagnosing occlusion MI\nWhat’s wrong with the STEMI label?\n\nClinicians don’t miss myocardial infarction under the STEMI/NSTEMI paradigm, they miss acute occlusions responsive to reperfusion therapy\nUnder the STEMI/NSTEMI paradigm, up to 30% of patients we classify as NSTEMI are consistently found to have missed acute coronary occlusion. Although these patients often end up receiving intervention at a later stage (24-72 hours) into admission, it is usually too late to salvage ischaemic or infarcted tissue and they are exposed to significant increases in morbidity and mortality\nA number of patients with benign ST elevation undergo unnecessary catheterisation +/- reperfusion therapy, exposing them to the associated risks of coronary dissections and perforations, arterial punctures with bleeding complications, contrast associated nephropathy, and early diagnostic closure\nMyers et al ( 2020 ) published a retrospective chart review of 467 high-risk ACS patients. They found that 40% of OMI did not present with STEMI criteria on ECG (STEMI(–) OMI). These patients suffered significant delays to cardiac catheterization despite having clinical, laboratory, and echo features of similar severity as the STEMI(+) OMI group.\nThe common culprits\nPublications since the 2000s describe ECG patterns without ST-segment elevation that signify acute coronary occlusion, and although there is increasing awareness of these patterns, they are yet to be included in formal diagnostic criteria and thus medical graduates and training clinicians are left with the black-and-white idea that the absence of ST elevation is a reassuring sign that this is “not a major coronary event”\nWe discuss five examples of ECG patterns that every clinician should look for in the acute chest pain ECG and which, if identified, should prompt cardiology consultation for consideration of immediate PCI",
  "Osborn wave": "Osborn Wave (J Wave) Overview\nThe Osborn wave (J wave) is a positive deflection seen at the J point in precordial and true limb leads. It is most commonly associated with hypothermia. These changes will appear as a reciprocal, negative deflection in aVR and V1.\nThe J point in the ECG is the point where the QRS complex joins the ST segment. It represents the approximate end of depolarization and the beginning of repolarization as determined by the surface ECG. There is an overlap of around 10ms.\nThe J point may deviate from the baseline in early repolarization, epicardial or endocardial ischemia or injury, pericarditis, RBBB, LBBB, RVH, LVH or digitalis effect.\n\nNote : The letter J on the ECG defines 2 totally different and unrelated events. The J point is a point in time marking the end of the QRS and the onset of the ST segment present on all ECGs. The J wave is a much less common, slow deflection of uncertain origin originally described in relation to hypothermia.\n\nOsborn Wave Causes\nCharacteristically seen in hypothermia (typically T < 30C), but they are not pathognomic. Causes of non-hypothermic Osborn waves include:\nHypercalcaemia [ Otero et al ]\nAcute myocardial ischaemia [ Maruyama et al ]\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy [ Zorzi et al ]\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy due to hypertension [ Patel et al ]\nNormal variant and early repolarization\nNeurological insults such as intracranial hypertension, severe head injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage\nSevere myocarditis\nBrugada syndrome [ Bjerregaard et al ]\nLe syndrome d’Haïssaguerre (idiopathic VF)\nNo definitive physiological cause for the deflection has been described, despite numerous postulates.\nCompared to other hypothermia-induced ECG abnormalities (e.g. sinus bradycardia; supraventricular arrhythmias, QT prolongation and AV block), the Osborn wave is thought to be the most specific .\n\nHistory\nEponymously associated with John Jay Osborn (1917-2014) following his 1953 ‘current of injury’ description in hypothermic dogs. See below for a deep dive into the eponymous history.\n\nOsborn Wave ECG examples",

If the patient’s native heart rate is above the pacemaker threshold, no pacemaker activity is expected and therefore output failure and capture failure cannot be recognised on the ECG.\nPacemaker Associated Dysrhythmias\nSeveral types of pacemaker associated dysrhythmias can occur including pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT), sensor-induced tachycardia, runaway pacemaker, pacemaker-mediated Wenckebach AV block and lead dislodgement dysrhythmia.\nPacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT)\nAlso known as endless-loop tachycardia or pacemaker circus movement tachycardia.\nPMT is a re-entry tachycardia in which the pacemaker forms the antegrade pathway with retrograde conduction occurring via the AV node\nCaused by retrograde p waves being sensed as native atrial activity with subsequent ventricular pacing\nThe paced ventricular complex results in further retrograde conduction with retrograde p wave generation thus forming a continuous cycle\nResults in a paced tachycardia with the maximum rate limited by the pacemaker programming\nCan be terminated by slowing AV conduction e.g. adenosine or activation of magnet mode\nNewer pacemakers contain programmed algorithms designed to terminate PMT\nMay result in rate related ischaemia in the presences of IHD\nSensor-induced tachycardia\nModern pacemakers are programmed to allow increased heart rates in response to physiological stimuli such as exercise, tachypnoea, hypercapnia or acidaemia\nSensors may “misfire” in the presence of distracting stimuli such as vibrations, loud noises, fever, limb movement, hyperventilation or electrocautery (e.g. during surgery)\nThis misfiring leads to pacing at an inappropriately fast rate\nThe ventricular rate cannot exceed the pacemaker’s upper rate limit (usually 160-180 bpm)\nThese will also usually terminate with application of a magnet\nRunaway pacemaker\nThis potentially life-threatening malfunction of older-generation pacemakers is related to low battery voltage (e.g. overdue pacemaker replacement)\nThe pacemaker delivers paroxysms of pacing spikes at 200 bpm, which may provoke ventricular fibrillation\nParadoxically, there may be failure to capture — causing bradycardia — because the pacing spikes are very low in amplitude (due to the depleted battery voltage) and because at very high rates the ventricle may become refractory to stimulation\nApplication of a magnet can be life saving but definitive treatment requires replacement of the pacemaker\nSome great cases of runaway pacemaker are discussed here\nLead displacement dysrhythmia\nA dislodged pacing lead may float around inside the right ventricle, intermittently “tickling” the myocardium and causing ventricular ectopics or runs of VT (in much the same way as the guide wire of a central line!), alternating with failure of capture\nIf the paced QRS morphology changes from a LBBB pattern (indicating RV placement) to a RBBB pattern (indicating LV placement), this suggests that the electrode has eroded through the interventricular septum\nA chest x-ray will usually help to confirm the diagnosis\nPacemaker Syndrome\nCaused by improper timing of atrial and ventricular contractions resulting in AV dyssynchrony and loss of atrial “kick”\nVariety of clinical symptoms including fatigue, dizziness, palpations, pre-syncope\nAssociated decrease in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg during change from native rhythm to paced rhythm\nTwiddler’s Syndrome\nPatient manipulation of the pulse generator (accidentally or deliberately)\nThe pacemaker rotates on its long axis, resulting in dislodgement of pacing leads\nCan result in diaphragmatic or brachial plexus pacing (e.g. arm twitching) depending on extent of lead migration\nECG in Pacemaker Malfunction\nNormal pacemaker rhythms can result in absent pacing activity, irregular pacing and absence of pacing spikes\nDiagnosis of pacemaker malfunction on the ECG is very difficult and may be impossible depending on the underlying native rhythm\nIf pacemaker malfunction is suspected cardiology review is required to facilitate pacemaker interrogation and testing",

  "Pericarditis": "Definition\nInflammation of the pericardium secondary to infection, localised injury or systemic disorders producing characteristic chest pain, dyspnoea and serial ECG changes.\nChest pain is often retrosternal in nature, pleuritic, and positional (relieved by sitting forward, worse lying flat)\nThere may be an associated pericardial friction rub, or ECG evidence of a pericardial effusion\nWidespread ST segment changes occur due to involvement of the underlying epicardium (i.e. myopericarditis)\nTTE is useful in the early assessment of patients with suspected pericarditis to look for complications such as large pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade\n\nCharacteristic ECG changes\nWidespread concave ST elevation and PR depression throughout most of the limb leads (I, II, III, aVL, aVF) and precordial leads (V2-6)\nReciprocal ST depression and PR elevation in lead aVR (± V1)\nSinus tachycardia is also common in acute pericarditis due to pain and/or pericardial effusion\nNB. ST- and PR-segment changes are relative to the baseline formed by the T-P segment. The degree of ST elevation is typically modest (0.5 – 1mm).\n\n\n\nStages of Pericarditis\nPericarditis is classically associated with ECG changes that evolve through four stages.\nStage 1 – widespread STE and PR depression with reciprocal changes in aVR (occurs during the first two weeks)\nStage 2 – normalisation of ST changes; generalised T wave flattening (1 to 3 weeks)\nStage 3 – flattened T waves become inverted (3 to several weeks)\nStage 4 – ECG returns to normal (several weeks onwards)\nNB. Less than 50% of patients progress through all four classical stages and evolution of changes may not follow this typical pattern.\nCauses of Pericarditis\nClassification can be primary versus secondary, acute versus chronic, or infectious versus immune-mediated.\nInfectious – mainly viral (e.g. coxsackie virus); occasionally bacterial, fungal, TB.\nImmunological – SLE, rheumatic fever\nUraemia\nPost-myocardial infarction or following cardiac surgery (Dressler’s syndrome)\nTrauma\nParaneoplastic syndromes\nDrug-induced (e.g. isoniazid, cyclosporin)\nPost-radiotherapy",

  "Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia": "Definitions\nPolymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) is a form of ventricular tachycardia in which there are multiple ventricular foci with the resultant QRS complex varying in amplitude, axis, and duration. The most common cause of PVT is myocardial ischaemia/infarction.\n\nFor TdP to be diagnosed, the patient must have evidence of both PVT and QT prolongation\nBidirectional VT is another specific type of of PVT, most commonly associated with digoxin toxicity\nFirst described by François Dessertenne (1917-2001) in 1966\n\nClinical Significance\nTdP is often short lived and self terminating, however can be associated with haemodynamic instability and collapse. TdP may also degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF)\nQT prolongation may occur secondary to multiple drug effects , electrolyte abnormalities and medical conditions; these may combine to produce TdP, e.g. hypokalaemia may precipitate TdP in a patient with congenital long QT syndrome\nRecognition of TdP and the risk of TdP allows the instigation of specific management strategies (e.g. magnesium, isoprenaline, overdrive pacing, etc.)\nFurther review of the causes of QT prolongation\n\nPathophysiology of TdP\nA prolonged QT reflects prolonged myocyte repolarisation due to ion channel malfunction\nThis prolonged repolarisation period also gives rise to early after-depolarisations (EADs)\nEADs may manifest on the ECG as tall U waves; if these reach threshold amplitude they may manifest as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)\nTdP is initiated when a PVC occurs during the preceding T wave, known as ‘R on T’ phenomenon\nThe onset of TdP is often preceded by a sequence of short-long-short R-R intervals, so called “pause dependent” TDP, with longer pauses associated with faster runs of TdP\n\nElectrocardiographic Pearls\nDuring short runs of TdP or single lead recording the characteristic “twisting” morphology may not be apparent\nBigeminy in a patient with a known long QT syndrome may herald imminent TdP\nTdP with heart rates > 220 beats/min are of longer duration and more likely to degenerate into VF\nPresence of abnormal (“giant”) T-U waves may precede TdP\n\nDrug-induced Torsades\nIn the context of acute poisoning with QT-prolonging agents, the risk of TdP is better described by the absolute rather than corrected QT\nMore precisely, the risk of TdP is determined by considering both the absolute QT interval and the simultaneous heart rate (i.e. on the same ECG tracing)\nThese values are then plotted on the QT nomogram (below) to determine whether the patient is at risk of TdP\nA QT interval-heart rate pair that plots above the line indicates that the patient is at significant risk of TdP",
  "Poor R wave progression (PRWP)": "Poor R Wave Progression Overview\nPoor R-wave progression (PRWP) is a common ECG finding that is often inconclusively interpreted as suggestive, but not diagnostic, of anterior myocardial infarction (AMI). PRWP is defined by R wave height ≤ 3 mm in V3\n\nCauses of PRWP\nThe major causes associated with PRWP include:\nPrior anteroseptal MI\nLeft Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)\nRight Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH)\nInaccurate lead placement (e.g. transposition of V1 and V3)\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nMay be a normal variant",
  "Posterior STEMI": "Posterior myocardial infarction (MI) accompanies 15-20% of STEMIs, usually occurring in the context of inferior or lateral infarction. Isolated posterior MI is less common (5-10% of infarcts), and the lack of ST elevation means that the diagnosis is often missed.\nPosterior extension of an inferior or lateral infarct implies a much larger area of myocardial damage, with an increased risk of left ventricular dysfunction and death. Always examine closely for evidence of posterior infarction in any patient with a lateral or inferior MI.\n\nECG diagnostic criteria\nAs the posterior myocardium is not directly visualised by the standard 12-lead ECG, reciprocal changes of STEMI are sought in the anteroseptal leads V1-3.\nHorizontal ST depression\nTall, broad R waves (> 30ms)\nUpright T waves\nDominant R wave (R/S ratio > 1) in V2\nIn patients presenting with ischaemic symptoms, horizontal ST depression in the anteroseptal leads (V1-3) should raise the suspicion of posterior MI.\n\nPosterior infarction is confirmed by the presence of ST elevation and Q waves in the posterior leads (V7-9).\n\nExplanation of the ECG changes in V1-3\nThe anteroseptal leads are directed from the anterior precordium towards the internal surface of the posterior myocardium. Because posterior electrical activity is recorded from the anterior side of the heart, the typical injury pattern of ST elevation and Q waves becomes inverted:\nST elevation becomes ST depression\nQ waves become R waves\nTerminal T-wave inversion becomes an upright T wave\nThe progressive development of pathological R waves in posterior infarction (the “Q wave equivalent”) mirrors the development of Q waves in anteroseptal STEMI.\n\nThis picture illustrates the reciprocal relationship between the ECG changes seen in STEMI and those seen with posterior infarction. The previous image (depicting posterior infarction in V2) has been inverted. See how the ECG now resembles a typical STEMI!\n\nPosterior leads\nLeads V7-9 are placed on the posterior chest wall in the following positions (see diagram below):\nV7 – Left posterior axillary line, in the same horizontal plane as V6\nV8 – Tip of the left scapula, in the same horizontal plane as V6\nV9 – Left paraspinal region, in the same horizontal plane as V6\n\nThe degree of ST elevation seen in V7-9 is typically modest – note that only 0.5 mm of ST elevation is required to make the diagnosis of posterior MI!",
  "Preexcitation syndrome": "This page covers the pathophysiology and ECG features of pre-excitation syndromes in sinus rhythm. The two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur due to accessory pathways are discussed separately — see atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT) and atrial fibrillation/flutter in pre-excitation .\n\nOverview of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome\nWPW Syndrome refers to the presence of a congenital accessory pathway (AP) and episodes of tachyarrhythmias. The term is often used interchangeablely with pre-excitation syndrome\nFirst described in 1930 by Louis Wolff , John Parkinson and Paul Dudley White\nIncidence is 0.1 – 3.0 per 1000\nAssociated with a small risk of sudden cardiac death\n\nECG features of WPW in sinus rhythm\nPR interval < 120ms\nDelta wave : slurring slow rise of initial portion of the QRS\nQRS prolongation > 110ms\nDiscordant ST-segment and T-wave changes (i.e. in the opposite direction to the major component of the QRS complex)\nPseudo-infarction pattern in up to 70% of patients — due to negatively deflected delta waves in inferior/anterior leads (“pseudo-Q waves”), or prominent R waves in V1-3 (mimicking posterior infarction)\n\n\nAberrant conduction via an AP leads to early ventricular depolarisation (pre-excitation), which manifests as a short PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex\nConduction still occurs via the AV node, and is actually a brake on AP conduction, ceasing its propagation path in the ventricle\nQRS duration is thus prolonged, but not to the same extent as in bundle branch block\nBecause there is an initial abnormal direction of depolarisation (e.g. originating from left ventricle in left-sided AP), there will be an abnormal direction of repolarisation. This produces appropriately discordant ST segment and T wave changes (see above diagram)\n\nPathophysiology of pre-excitation and APs\nPre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an AP. Also known as bypass tracts, APs are abnormal conduction pathways formed during cardiac development and can exist in a variety of anatomical locations and in some patients there may be multiple pathways. In WPW, the AP is sometimes referred to as the Bundle of Kent , or atrioventricular bypass tract.\n\nAn AP can conduct impulses in three ways:\nIn both directions (majority)\nRetrograde only , away from the ventricle (15%)\nAnterograde only , towards the ventricle (rare)\nThe direction of conduction affects the appearance of the ECG in sinus rhythm and during tachyarrhythmias.\nAPs can be left-sided or right-sided , and ECG features will vary depending on this:\nLeft-sided AP: produces a positive delta wave in all precordial leads, with R/S > 1 in V 1 . Sometimes referred to as a type A WPW pattern\nRight-sided AP: produces a negative delta wave in leads V 1 and V 2 . Sometimes referred to as a type B WPW pattern\nNote that the features of pre-excitation may be subtle, or present only intermittently. Pre-excitation may be more pronounced with increased vagal tone e.g. during Valsalva manoeuvres, or with AV blockade e.g. drug therapy.\n\nConcealed pathway\nIn patients with retrograde-only accessory conduction, all anterograde conduction occurs via the AV node. No pre-excitation occurs and therefore no features of WPW are seen on the ECG in sinus rhythm. This is termed a “concealed pathway”. These patients can still experience tachyarrhythmias, as the pathway can still form part of a re-entry circuit.\n\nTachyarrhythmias in WPW\nThere are only two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur in patients with WPW — these are discussed separately:\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter . Due to direct conduction from atria to ventricles via an AP, bypassing the AV node\nAtrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT). Due to formation of a re-entry circuit involving the AP\n\n\nOther Pre-Excitation Syndromes / Accessory Pathways\nLown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) Syndrome\nProposed pre-excitation syndrome.

Existence is disputed.\n\nMahaim-Type Pre-excitation\nRight sided APs connecting either AV node to ventricles, fascicles to ventricles, or atria to fascicles.\nECG features:\nSinus rhythm ECG may be normal\nMay result in variation in ventricular morphology\nRe-entry tachycardia typically has LBBB morphology",
  "Premature complexes, atrial": "A premature atrial complex (PAC) is a premature beat arising from ectopic pacemaking tissue within the atria.

P waves will still be visible in both cases\n\nUnlike with a premature ventricular complexe (PVC), the post-extrasystolic pause is not equal to double the preceding RR interval\n\nP wave morphology\nThe P wave typically has a different morphology and axis to the sinus P waves\nPACs arising close to the AV node (“low atrial” ectopics) cause retrograde activation of the atria, producing an inverted P wave with a relatively short PR interval ≥ 120 ms (PR interval < 120 ms is classified as a PJC)\nThe abnormal P wave may be hidden in the preceding T wave, producing a “peaked” or “camel hump” appearance — if this is not appreciated the PAC may be mistaken for a premature junctional complex (PJC)\n\nAberrancy and “blocked” PACs\nPACs arriving early in the cycle may be conducted aberrantly, usually with a RBBB morphology (as the right bundle branch has a longer refractory period than the left). They can be differentiated from PVCs by the presence of a preceding P wave\nSimilarly, PACs arriving very early in the cycle may not be conducted to the ventricles at all. In this case, you will see an abnormal P wave that is not followed by a QRS complex (“blocked PAC”).

  "QT syndrome - Short (SQTS)": "Overview of SQTS\nFamilial arrhythmogenic disease associated with paroxysmal atrial and ventricular fibrillation, syncope, and sudden cardiac death\nGenetically-inherited cardiac channelopathy, on the same spectrum as other familial arrhythmogenic diseases such as Long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada Syndrome , and Catecholamine Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)\nPatients are typically young and healthy, with no structural heart abnormalities; age at first presentation ranges from a few months to the sixth decade of life (median age = 30 years)\nThe most common initial presenting symptom is cardiac arrest (in one-third of cases); other patients may present with palpitations or syncope due to rapid atrial fibrillation or self-terminating ventricular arrhythmias\nWitnessed cardiac arrest within the first year of life and unexplained infant deaths have been observed in patients and families with SQTS, making it a possible cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\nSQTS is still a relatively new disease – it was first described in 2000, and elucidation of the genetic, electrophysiological and clinical abnormalities associated with the disease has only taken place over the past few years\n\n\nDiagnosis\nAt present, there are no diagnostic criteria for SQTS. The diagnosis is based upon the patient’s symptoms (e.g. syncope, palpitations), family history (of syncope, sudden death or atrial fibrillation at an early age) and characteristic findings on the 12-lead ECG.\n\nClinical features\nSo far, there have only been a handful of cases of SQTS reported in the literature. The true prevalence of the disease is unknown. The largest case series to date reported on 29 patients with the disease:\nThe most common presenting symptom was cardiac arrest (in one-third of cases)\nCardiac arrest occurred in the first months of life in two patients.\nSyncope was the presenting symptom in 24% of cases, thought to be secondary to self-terminating episodes of ventricular fibrillation\nUp to 31% of patients complained of palpitations , and 80% of patients had documented episodes of atrial fibrillation\nAll patients had a QT < 320ms and a QTc < 340ms with no evidence of structural heart disease ( NB. This case series did not include the more recently-described SQTS genotypes 4 & 5 )\n\nECG features\nShort QT interval\nLack of normal changes in QT interval with heart rate\nPeaked T waves, particularly in precordial leads\nShort, or absent, ST segments\nParoxysmal episodes of atrial or ventricular fibrillation\n\nQT, ST and T-wave changes in SQTS\n\nShort QT interval, peaked T waves and short ST segments in two patients with SQTS 1.\n\nMechanism\nArrhythmogenesis in SQTS is thought to result from:\nExtremely short atrial and ventricular refractory periods (manifest on the ECG as a short QT interval)\nTransmural dispersion of repolarisation , i.e., the different layers of the myocardium (endocardium, epicardium and the mid-myocardial ‘M-cells’) repolarise at different rates\nBoth these repolarisation abnormalities convey an increased susceptibility to re-entrant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nShort QT interval\nThere is currently no universally accepted lower limit of normal for the QT interval that can be used to diagnose SQTS.\nKnown patients with SQTS genotypes 1-3 all had QTc intervals < 300-320 ms\nKnown patients with SQTS genotypes 4 & 5 all had QTc intervals < 360 ms\nA recent review by Viskin suggested the following approach:\nQTc intervals < 330 ms in males or < 340 ms in females should be considered diagnostic of SQTS\nQTc intervals < 360 ms in males or < 370 ms in females should only be considered diagnostic of SQTS when supported by symptoms or family history\n\n\nLack of normal changes in QT with heart rate\nPatients with SQTS demonstrate fixed QT intervals which remain constant over a range of heart rates\nAt fast heart rates, the calculated QTc may appear normal (= ”pseudonormal” QTc)\nHowever, as the heart rate slows, the QTc typically fails to prolong.\nSerial ECGs or Holter monitoring at rest may be used to try and capture short QT intervals during periods of relative bradycardia (heart rate 60-80bpm)\nExercise testing may demonstrate lack of adaptation of QT interval with different heart rates.\n\nHolter strip from a patient with SQTS at heart rates of 68 and 119 bpm.\nQT interval of 280 ms remains constant at both heart rates.\nReproduced from Short QT Syndrome.org\n\nElectrophysiological Studies\nElectrophysiological studies in SQTS demonstrate:\nExtremely short atrial and ventricular refractory periods\nHigh rates of inducible atrial and ventricular fibrillation\nMarked vulnerability to mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation\nThe role of EP studies in diagnosing and risk-stratifying patients with SQTS has not yet been established\n\nTreatment Options\nAt present, the only effective treatment is implantation of an ICD\nThe main problem with this is T-wave oversensing and inappropriate shocks due to the tall, narrow T waves seen in SQTS\nEfforts to find a suitable pharmacological treatment have focused on potassium blocking anti-arrhythmic agents (classes Ia and III)\nClass III agents ibutilide and sotalol , while having theoretical benefits in prolonging QT and suppressing arrhythmias, have been shown to be ineffective due to reduced drug binding to mutated potassium channels\nClass Ia agents quinidine and disopyramide have shown more promising effects. Quinidine is currently the agent of choice, having been shown in SQTS 1 patients to markedly prolong both the QT interval and ventricular refractory period, with normalisation of ST segments and T waves and prevention of VF induction\n\nGenetic Basis\nSQTS is a genetically heterogenous disease, with multiple mutations producing a similar clinical picture. Five mutations have been characterised so far, all of which seem to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\nSQTS genotypes 1-3 are produced by a gain-of-function mutation in myocardial potassium channels (the opposite to LQTS), with increased potassium efflux during various stages of the action potential leading to more rapid atrial and ventricular repolarisation with marked shortening of the QT interval (<320 ms).\nSQTS genotypes 4 and 5 are produced by a loss-of-function mutation in the L-type cardiac channel, with reduced influx of calcium during the plateau phase of the action potential leading to modest shortening of the QT interval (<360ms) associated with a Brugada-syndrome-like QRS complex morphology.\nPotassium fluxes in SQTS 1-3\n\nA.

  "Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia": "Overview\nRight ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is a form of monomorphic VT originating from the outflow tract of the right ventricle or occasionally from the tricuspid annulus.

RVOT VT can originate from any of these sites but carry common ECG characteristics.\nECG features\nLBBB morphology\nInferior axis\nrS complex in V1 and R complex in V6\nPrecordial transition usually ≥ V3, with the exception of septal origin, which occurs at ≤ V3\nOther general features of VT , such as AV dissociation, fusion and/or capture beats may also be present.\n\nCauses\nIdiopathic VT\nRVOT tachycardia is most commonly a form of idiopathic VT, whereby no structural heart disease, metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, or long QT syndrome can be found. There are two main forms of clinical presentation:\nRepetitive, unsustained, monomorphic VT is the most common form seen in 60-90%\nExercise-induced sustained ventricular arrhythmias\nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)\nARVD is a genetic disorder of myocardium in which there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall, and accounts for up to 10% of sudden cardiac death in individuals under 65 years of age. Affected individuals often present with exercise-induced episodes of VT accompanied by LBBB morphology.\nDifferentiation between idiopathic RVOT tachycardia and that caused by ARVD can be difficult and may rely on previous ECG findings as well as family history.\nClinical implications\nRVOT tachycardia can be difficult to distinguish from SVT with LBBB\nInferior axis (+90 degrees) is usually the most differentiating feature, but other features of VT such as AV dissociation may be present\nTreatment:\nAcute termination of idiopathic RVOT tachycardia in a stable patient can be achieved by vagal manoeuvres or adenosine (6mg up to 24mg)\nIV verapamil is an alternative if the patient has an adequate blood pressure reserve\nRVOT tachycardia in ARVD does not terminate with adenosine\nIn stable patients with a regular broad complex tachycardia, adenosine is useful and safe as a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic agent.",

The most important change is the modification of the rule for excessive discordance .\nThe use of a 5 mm cutoff for excessive discordance was arbitrary and non-specific — for example, patients with LBBB and large voltages will commonly have ST deviations > 5 mm in the absence of ischaemia. The modified rule is positive for “STEMI” if there is discordant ST elevation with amplitude > 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave.\nSmith-Modified Sgarbossa Criteria:\nConcordant ST elevation ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead\nConcordant ST depression ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 1 lead of V1-V3\nProportionally excessive discordant STE in ≥ 1 lead anywhere with ≥ 1 mm STE, as defined by ≥ 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave\nSee the modified Sgarbossa criteria in action in this excellent case study by Stephen Smith and references for the 1) Derivation and 2) validation of the Smith-Modified criteria",

  "Short QT syndrome": "Overview of SQTS\nFamilial arrhythmogenic disease associated with paroxysmal atrial and ventricular fibrillation, syncope, and sudden cardiac death\nGenetically-inherited cardiac channelopathy, on the same spectrum as other familial arrhythmogenic diseases such as Long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada Syndrome , and Catecholamine Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT)\nPatients are typically young and healthy, with no structural heart abnormalities; age at first presentation ranges from a few months to the sixth decade of life (median age = 30 years)\nThe most common initial presenting symptom is cardiac arrest (in one-third of cases); other patients may present with palpitations or syncope due to rapid atrial fibrillation or self-terminating ventricular arrhythmias\nWitnessed cardiac arrest within the first year of life and unexplained infant deaths have been observed in patients and families with SQTS, making it a possible cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)\nSQTS is still a relatively new disease – it was first described in 2000, and elucidation of the genetic, electrophysiological and clinical abnormalities associated with the disease has only taken place over the past few years\n\n\nDiagnosis\nAt present, there are no diagnostic criteria for SQTS. The diagnosis is based upon the patient’s symptoms (e.g. syncope, palpitations), family history (of syncope, sudden death or atrial fibrillation at an early age) and characteristic findings on the 12-lead ECG.\n\nClinical features\nSo far, there have only been a handful of cases of SQTS reported in the literature. The true prevalence of the disease is unknown. The largest case series to date reported on 29 patients with the disease:\nThe most common presenting symptom was cardiac arrest (in one-third of cases)\nCardiac arrest occurred in the first months of life in two patients.\nSyncope was the presenting symptom in 24% of cases, thought to be secondary to self-terminating episodes of ventricular fibrillation\nUp to 31% of patients complained of palpitations , and 80% of patients had documented episodes of atrial fibrillation\nAll patients had a QT < 320ms and a QTc < 340ms with no evidence of structural heart disease ( NB. This case series did not include the more recently-described SQTS genotypes 4 & 5 )\n\nECG features\nShort QT interval\nLack of normal changes in QT interval with heart rate\nPeaked T waves, particularly in precordial leads\nShort, or absent, ST segments\nParoxysmal episodes of atrial or ventricular fibrillation\n\nQT, ST and T-wave changes in SQTS\n\nShort QT interval, peaked T waves and short ST segments in two patients with SQTS 1.\n\nMechanism\nArrhythmogenesis in SQTS is thought to result from:\nExtremely short atrial and ventricular refractory periods (manifest on the ECG as a short QT interval)\nTransmural dispersion of repolarisation , i.e., the different layers of the myocardium (endocardium, epicardium and the mid-myocardial ‘M-cells’) repolarise at different rates\nBoth these repolarisation abnormalities convey an increased susceptibility to re-entrant atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nShort QT interval\nThere is currently no universally accepted lower limit of normal for the QT interval that can be used to diagnose SQTS.\nKnown patients with SQTS genotypes 1-3 all had QTc intervals < 300-320 ms\nKnown patients with SQTS genotypes 4 & 5 all had QTc intervals < 360 ms\nA recent review by Viskin suggested the following approach:\nQTc intervals < 330 ms in males or < 340 ms in females should be considered diagnostic of SQTS\nQTc intervals < 360 ms in males or < 370 ms in females should only be considered diagnostic of SQTS when supported by symptoms or family history\n\n\nLack of normal changes in QT with heart rate\nPatients with SQTS demonstrate fixed QT intervals which remain constant over a range of heart rates\nAt fast heart rates, the calculated QTc may appear normal (= ”pseudonormal” QTc)\nHowever, as the heart rate slows, the QTc typically fails to prolong.\nSerial ECGs or Holter monitoring at rest may be used to try and capture short QT intervals during periods of relative bradycardia (heart rate 60-80bpm)\nExercise testing may demonstrate lack of adaptation of QT interval with different heart rates.\n\nHolter strip from a patient with SQTS at heart rates of 68 and 119 bpm.\nQT interval of 280 ms remains constant at both heart rates.\nReproduced from Short QT Syndrome.org\n\nElectrophysiological Studies\nElectrophysiological studies in SQTS demonstrate:\nExtremely short atrial and ventricular refractory periods\nHigh rates of inducible atrial and ventricular fibrillation\nMarked vulnerability to mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation\nThe role of EP studies in diagnosing and risk-stratifying patients with SQTS has not yet been established\n\nTreatment Options\nAt present, the only effective treatment is implantation of an ICD\nThe main problem with this is T-wave oversensing and inappropriate shocks due to the tall, narrow T waves seen in SQTS\nEfforts to find a suitable pharmacological treatment have focused on potassium blocking anti-arrhythmic agents (classes Ia and III)\nClass III agents ibutilide and sotalol , while having theoretical benefits in prolonging QT and suppressing arrhythmias, have been shown to be ineffective due to reduced drug binding to mutated potassium channels\nClass Ia agents quinidine and disopyramide have shown more promising effects. Quinidine is currently the agent of choice, having been shown in SQTS 1 patients to markedly prolong both the QT interval and ventricular refractory period, with normalisation of ST segments and T waves and prevention of VF induction\n\nGenetic Basis\nSQTS is a genetically heterogenous disease, with multiple mutations producing a similar clinical picture. Five mutations have been characterised so far, all of which seem to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.\nSQTS genotypes 1-3 are produced by a gain-of-function mutation in myocardial potassium channels (the opposite to LQTS), with increased potassium efflux during various stages of the action potential leading to more rapid atrial and ventricular repolarisation with marked shortening of the QT interval (<320 ms).\nSQTS genotypes 4 and 5 are produced by a loss-of-function mutation in the L-type cardiac channel, with reduced influx of calcium during the plateau phase of the action potential leading to modest shortening of the QT interval (<360ms) associated with a Brugada-syndrome-like QRS complex morphology.\nPotassium fluxes in SQTS 1-3\n\nA.

  "Sinus node exit block": "SA Exit Block Overview\nSinoatrial exit block is due to failed propagation of pacemaker impulses beyond the SA node.\nThe sinoatrial node continues to depolarise normally.\nHowever, some of the sinus impulses are “blocked” before they can leave the SA node, leading to intermittent failure of atrial depolarisation (dropped P waves).\n\nAnatomical Basis\nThe SA node consists of two main groups of cells:\nA central core of pacemaking cells ( P cells ) that produce the sinus impulses.\nAn outer layer of transitional cells ( T cells ) that transmit the sinus impulses out into the right atrium.\n\nSinus node dysfunction can result from either:\nFailure of the P cells to produce an impulse. This leads to sinus pauses and sinus arrest.\nFailure of the T cells to transmit the impulse. This leads to sino-atrial exit block.\n\nPatterns of conduction\nThe patterns of conduction in SA exit block are identical to the different types of AV block.\nHowever, as the initial sinus impulse is not visible on the ECG, the relationship between impulse generation and transmission must be inferred from the P waves alone (analogous to examining only the R waves in AV block).\nOnly second degree SA block (types I and II) can be diagnosed from the 12-lead ECG.\n\nFirst Degree SA block\n= Delay between impulse generation and transmission to the atrium.﻿\nThis abnormality is not detectable on the surface ECG.\n\nSecond Degree SA block, Type I (Wenckebach)\n= Progressive lengthening of the interval between impulse generation and transmission, culminating in failure of transmission.\nThe gradually lengthening transmission interval pushes successive P waves closer together.\nThis results in grouping of the P-QRS complexes.\nPauses due to dropped P waves occur at the end of each group.\nThe P-P interval progressively shortens prior to the dropped P wave.\nThis pattern is easily mistaken for sinus arrhythmia.\n\nSecond Degree SA block, Type II\n= Intermittent dropped P waves with a constant interval between impulse generation and atrial depolarisation.\nThis pattern is the equivalent of Mobitz II.\nThere is no clustering of P-QRS complexes.\nIntermittent P waves “drop out” of the rhythm, while subsequent P waves arrive “on time”.\nThe pause surrounding the dropped P wave is an exact multiple of the preceding P-P interval.\n\nThird Degree SA Block\n= None of the sinus impulses are conducted to the right atrium.\nThere is a complete absence of P waves.\nThe onset of 3rd degree SA block may produce long sinus pauses or sinus arrest (may lead to fatal asystole).\nRhythm may be maintained by a junctional escape rhythm.\nThird degree SA exit block is indistinguishable from sinus arrest due to pacemaker cell failure. It can only be diagnosed with a sinus node electrode during electrophysiological evaluation.\n\nCauses of sinoatrial exit block\nSick sinus syndrome\nIncreased vagal tone (athletes)\nVagal stimulation (surgery, pain)\nInferior myocardial infarction\nMyocarditis\nDrugs: digoxin , beta-blockers , calcium channel blockers , amiodarone.",
  "Sinus node reentrant tachycardia": "Definition\nThe term supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to any tachydysrhythmia arising from above the level of the Bundle of His, and encompasses regular atrial, irregular atrial, and regular atrioventricular tachycardias\nIt is often used synonymously with AV nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) , a form of SVT\nIn the absence of aberrant conduction (e.g. bundle branch block), the ECG will demonstrate a narrow complex tachycardia\nParoxysmal SVT (pSVT) describes an SVT with abrupt onset and offset – characteristically seen with re-entrant tachycardias involving the AV node such as AVNRT or atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT)\n\nClassification\nSVTs can be classified based on: Site of origin (atria or AV node) or; Regularity (regular or irregular)\nClassification based on QRS width is unhelpful as this is also influenced by the presence of pre-existing bundle branch block, rate-related aberrant conduction, or presence of accessory pathways.\n\nClassification of SVT by site of origin and regularity\nSinus tachycardia\nAtrial tachycardia\nAtrial flutter\nInappropriate sinus tachycardia\nSinus node reentrant tachycardia\nRegular Atrioventricular\nAVRT\nAVNRT\nAutomatic junctional tachycardia\n\nAV Nodal Re-entry Tachycardia (AVNRT)\nThis is the commonest cause of palpitations in patients with structurally normal hearts\nAVNRT is typically paroxysmal and may occur spontaneously or upon provocation with exertion, caffeine, alcohol, beta-agonists (salbutamol) or sympathomimetics (amphetamines)\nIt is more common in women than men (~ 75% of cases occurring in women) and may occur in young and healthy patients as well as those suffering chronic heart disease\nPatients will typically complain of the sudden onset of rapid, regular palpitations. Other associated symptoms may include: Presyncope or syncope due to a transient fall in blood pressure Chest pain, especially in the context of underlying coronary artery disease Dyspnoea Anxiety Rarely, polyuria due to elevated atrial pressures causing release of atrial natriuretic peptide\nThe tachycardia typically ranges between 140-280 bpm and is regular in nature. It may self-resolve or continue indefinitely until medical treatment is sought\nThe condition is generally well tolerated and is rarely life threatening in patients with pre-existing heart disease\nPathophysiology\nIn comparison to AVRT , which involves an anatomical re-entry circuit (Bundle of Kent), in AVNRT there is a functional re-entry circuit within the AV node.\n\nAlrternate re-entry loops: Functional circuit in AVNRT (left), anatomical circuit in AVRT (right)\n\nFunctional pathways within the AV node\nThere are two pathways within the AV node:\nThe slow pathway ( alpha ): a slowly-conducting pathway with a short refractory period.\nThe fast pathway ( beta ): a rapidly-conducting pathway with a long refractory period.\n\nInitiation of re-entry\nDuring normal sinus rhythm, electrical impulses travel down both pathways simultaneously. The impulse transmitted down the fast pathway enters the distal end of the slow pathway and the two impulses cancel each other out\nHowever, if a premature atrial contraction (PAC) arrives while the fast pathway is still refractory, the electrical impulse will be directed solely down the slow pathway (1)\nBy the time the premature impulse reaches the end of the slow pathway, the fast pathway is no longer refractory, and the impulse is permitted to recycle retrogradely up the fast pathway (2)\nThis creates a circus movement whereby the impulse continually cycles around the two pathways, activating the Bundle of His anterogradely and the atria retrogradely (3)\nThe short cycle length is responsible for the rapid heart rate\nThis most common type of re-entrant circuit is termed Slow-Fast AVNRT\nSimilar mechanisms exist for the other types of AVNRT\nElectrocardiographic Features\nECG features of AVNRT\nRegular tachycardia ~140-280 bpm\nNarrow QRS complexes (< 120ms) unless there is co-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction\nP waves if visible exhibit retrograde conduction with P-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF.

Slow-Fast AVNRT (common type)\nAccounts for 80-90% of AVNRT\nAssociated with slow AV nodal pathway for anterograde conduction and fast AV nodal pathway for retrograde conduction\nThe retrograde P wave is obscured in the corresponding QRS or occurs at the end of the QRS complex as pseudo R’ or S waves\nECG features:\nP waves are often hidden – being embedded in the QRS complexes\nPseudo R’ wave may be seen in V1 or V2\nPseudo S waves may be seen in leads II, III or aVF\nIn most cases this results in a ‘typical’ SVT appearance with absent P waves and tachycardia\n\n\n2. Fast-Slow AVNRT (Uncommon AVNRT)\nAccounts for 10% of AVNRT\nAssociated with Fast AV nodal pathway for anterograde conduction and Slow AV nodal pathway for retrograde conduction\nDue to the relatively long ventriculo-atrial interval , the retrograde P wave is more likely to be visible after the corresponding QRS\nECG features:\nQRS-P-T complexes\nRetrograde P waves are visible between the QRS and T wave\n\n3.

  "ST elevation in aVR (LMCA/3VD)": "Left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis\nProximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis\nSevere triple vessel disease\nHypoxia or hypotension, for example following resuscitation from cardiac arrest\nST elevation in aVR can also be seen in the context of anterior STEMI due to LAD occlusion proximal to the first septal branch, causing infarction of the basal septum. Such cases will have associated ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.\n\n\nMechanism of ST elevation (STE) in aVR\nLead aVR is electrically opposite to the left-sided leads I, II, aVL and V4-6. In the case of subendocardial ischaemia, ST elevation in aVR is simply a reciprocal change to ST depression in these leads\nST depression does not localise , and thus subendocardial ischaemia due to oxygen supply/demand mismatch produces a consistent ECG pattern of widespread ST depression, usually most prominent in leads I, II, V4-6, and reciprocal ST elevation in aVR\nLead aVR also directly records electrical activity from the right upper portion of the heart, including the right ventricular outflow tract and the basal portion of the interventricular septum. Infarction in this area could theoretically produce ST elevation in aVR\n\nCause of ST elevation (STE) in AVR\nTwo possible mechanisms:\nDiffuse subendocardial ischaemia , with widespread ST depression producing reciprocal change in aVR (most common)\nInfarction of the basal septum , i.e. a STEMI involving aVR\nThe basal septum is supplied by the first septal perforator artery (a very proximal branch of the LAD), so ischaemia / infarction of the basal septum would imply involvement of the proximal LAD.\n\nLMCA “occlusion”: a misnomer\nST elevation in aVR with coexistent multi-lead ST depression can be a sign of Non-Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (NOMI) due to severe single or multi-vessel disease, but does not usually represent acute LMCA occlusion as once thought. Such acute occlusion most often causes sudden cardiac death due to simultaneous anterior, lateral and posterior STEMI.\nMore recent publications recognise this ECG pattern as consistent with left main coronary artery subocclusion or complete occlusion with well-developed collateral circulation. A 2019 single-centre retrospective analysis identified patients presenting with STE-aVR with multilead ST depression. Coronary occlusion was found only in 10% of patients, and none of these lesions were involving the LAD or left main coronary artery\n\nPredictive Value of STE in aVR\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm indicates proximal LAD / LMCA stenosis or severe 3VD\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm predicts the need for CABG\nAbsence of ST elevation in aVR almost entirely excludes a significant LMCA lesion\n\nDeep Dive into the literature of aVR\nPopulation : 113 patients with unstable angina, including 20 patients with LMCA stenosis and 24 patients with 3VD\nFindings : Patients with LMCA or 3VD frequently demonstrated ST-segment depression in multiple leads (typically I, II  and V4-V6) plus ST-segment elevation in lead aVR during attacks of angina",
  "STEMI, anterior": "ECG Features of Anterior STEMI\nST segment elevation with subsequent Q wave formation in precordial leads (V1-6) +/- high lateral leads. These changes are often preceded by hyperacute T waves\nReciprocal ST depression in inferior leads (mainly III and aVF)\nNB: The magnitude of reciprocal change in inferior leads is determined by the magnitude of ST elevation in I and aVL (as these leads are electrically opposite III and aVF), and hence may be minimal or absent in anterior STEMIs that do not involve high lateral leads.\n\nClinical Relevance of Anterior Myocardial Infarction\nAnterior STEMI usually results from occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) . Anterior myocardial infarction carries the poorest prognosis of all infarct locations, due to the larger area of myocardium infarct size.\nA study comparing outcomes from anterior and inferior infarctions (STEMI + NSTEMI) found that compared with inferior MI, patients with anterior MI had higher incidences of:\nIn-hospital mortality (11.9 vs 2.8%)\nTotal mortality (27 vs 11%)\nHeart failure (41 vs 15%)\nSignificant ventricular ectopic activity (70 vs 59%)\nLower ejection fraction on admission (38 vs 55%)\nIn addition to anterior STEMI, other high-risk presentations of anterior ischaemia include left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis , Wellens syndrome and De Winter T waves .\n\nPatterns of Anterior Infarction\nThe nomenclature of anterior infarction can be confusing, with multiple different terms used for the various infarction patterns. The following is a simplified approach to naming the different types of anterior MI.\nThe precordial leads can be classified as follows:\nSeptal leads = V1-2\nAnterior leads = V3-4\nLateral leads = V5-6\n\nThe different infarct patterns are named according to the leads with maximal ST elevation:\nSeptal = V1-2\nAnterior = V2-5\nAnteroseptal = V1-4\nAnterolateral = V3-6, I + aVL\nExtensive anterior  / anterolateral = V1-6, I + aVL\nNB: While these definitions are intuitive, there is often a poor correlation between ECG features and precise infarct location as determined by imaging or autopsy. For an alternative approach to the naming of myocardial infarctions, take a look at this 2006 article from Circulation .\n\nClinical Pearls\nOther important ECG patterns to be aware of:\nAnterior-inferior STEMI due to occlusion of a “ wraparound ” LAD .

The injury current in RCA occlusion is directed inferiorly and rightward, producing ST elevation in lead III > lead II (as lead III is more rightward facing)\nThe LCx territory covers the lateral part of the inferior wall and the left posterobasal area. The injury current in LCx occlusion is directed inferiorly and leftward, producing ST elevation in the lateral leads I and V5-6\nThese differences allow for electrocardiographic differentiation between RCA and LCx occlusion.\n\nRCA occlusion is suggested by:\nST elevation in lead III > lead II\nPresence of reciprocal ST depression in lead I\nSigns of right ventricular infarction : STE in V1 and V4R\n\nCircumflex occlusion is suggested by:\nST elevation in lead II = lead III\nAbsence of reciprocal ST depression in lead I\nSigns of lateral infarction: ST elevation in the lateral leads I and aVL or V5-6",

  "STEMI, posterior": "Posterior myocardial infarction (MI) accompanies 15-20% of STEMIs, usually occurring in the context of inferior or lateral infarction. Isolated posterior MI is less common (5-10% of infarcts), and the lack of ST elevation means that the diagnosis is often missed.\nPosterior extension of an inferior or lateral infarct implies a much larger area of myocardial damage, with an increased risk of left ventricular dysfunction and death. Always examine closely for evidence of posterior infarction in any patient with a lateral or inferior MI.\n\nECG diagnostic criteria\nAs the posterior myocardium is not directly visualised by the standard 12-lead ECG, reciprocal changes of STEMI are sought in the anteroseptal leads V1-3.\nHorizontal ST depression\nTall, broad R waves (> 30ms)\nUpright T waves\nDominant R wave (R/S ratio > 1) in V2\nIn patients presenting with ischaemic symptoms, horizontal ST depression in the anteroseptal leads (V1-3) should raise the suspicion of posterior MI.\n\nPosterior infarction is confirmed by the presence of ST elevation and Q waves in the posterior leads (V7-9).\n\nExplanation of the ECG changes in V1-3\nThe anteroseptal leads are directed from the anterior precordium towards the internal surface of the posterior myocardium. Because posterior electrical activity is recorded from the anterior side of the heart, the typical injury pattern of ST elevation and Q waves becomes inverted:\nST elevation becomes ST depression\nQ waves become R waves\nTerminal T-wave inversion becomes an upright T wave\nThe progressive development of pathological R waves in posterior infarction (the “Q wave equivalent”) mirrors the development of Q waves in anteroseptal STEMI.\n\nThis picture illustrates the reciprocal relationship between the ECG changes seen in STEMI and those seen with posterior infarction. The previous image (depicting posterior infarction in V2) has been inverted. See how the ECG now resembles a typical STEMI!\n\nPosterior leads\nLeads V7-9 are placed on the posterior chest wall in the following positions (see diagram below):\nV7 – Left posterior axillary line, in the same horizontal plane as V6\nV8 – Tip of the left scapula, in the same horizontal plane as V6\nV9 – Left paraspinal region, in the same horizontal plane as V6\n\nThe degree of ST elevation seen in V7-9 is typically modest – note that only 0.5 mm of ST elevation is required to make the diagnosis of posterior MI!",

Other associated symptoms may include: Presyncope or syncope due to a transient fall in blood pressure Chest pain, especially in the context of underlying coronary artery disease Dyspnoea Anxiety Rarely, polyuria due to elevated atrial pressures causing release of atrial natriuretic peptide\nThe tachycardia typically ranges between 140-280 bpm and is regular in nature.

The impulse transmitted down the fast pathway enters the distal end of the slow pathway and the two impulses cancel each other out\nHowever, if a premature atrial contraction (PAC) arrives while the fast pathway is still refractory, the electrical impulse will be directed solely down the slow pathway (1)\nBy the time the premature impulse reaches the end of the slow pathway, the fast pathway is no longer refractory, and the impulse is permitted to recycle retrogradely up the fast pathway (2)\nThis creates a circus movement whereby the impulse continually cycles around the two pathways, activating the Bundle of His anterogradely and the atria retrogradely (3)\nThe short cycle length is responsible for the rapid heart rate\nThis most common type of re-entrant circuit is termed Slow-Fast AVNRT\nSimilar mechanisms exist for the other types of AVNRT\nElectrocardiographic Features\nECG features of AVNRT\nRegular tachycardia ~140-280 bpm\nNarrow QRS complexes (< 120ms) unless there is co-existing bundle branch block, accessory pathway, or rate-related aberrant conduction\nP waves if visible exhibit retrograde conduction with P-wave inversion in leads II, III, aVF.

In TCM, apical dyskinesia and subsequent ballooning creates an LV appearance remarkably similiar to this octopus pot.\n(A) Ventriculogram (B) An octopus pot (“Takotsubo”) Takotsubo ventriculogram\n\n\n\nPathophysiology\nPathophysiology is thought to be related to a combination of sympathetic nervous system activation, microvascular spasm, and underlying LVOT obstruction:\nAn acute stress response leads to a catecholamine surge\nEnsuing sympathetic nervous system activation causes microvascular spasm. The apical distribution of the left ventricle has the highest density of sympathetic nervous system fibres which may explain the characteristic regional wall dyskinesia.\nIn at least one-third of cases, there is a degree of underlying left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, which increases LV workload, worsening sympathetic nervous system activation and apical dyskinesis. These patients usually have more severe disease and a poorer prognosis\n\nThe condition can be prevented in a laboratory by cardiac sympathectomy, and similar cardiac histopathological features are seen in patients who have suffered a subarachnoid haemorrhage.\n\nClinical significance\n90% of cases worldwide occur in post-menopausal women, usually associated with sudden emotional stress.

  "Torsades de Pointes": "Definitions\nPolymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) is a form of ventricular tachycardia in which there are multiple ventricular foci with the resultant QRS complex varying in amplitude, axis, and duration. The most common cause of PVT is myocardial ischaemia/infarction.\n\nFor TdP to be diagnosed, the patient must have evidence of both PVT and QT prolongation\nBidirectional VT is another specific type of of PVT, most commonly associated with digoxin toxicity\nFirst described by François Dessertenne (1917-2001) in 1966\n\nClinical Significance\nTdP is often short lived and self terminating, however can be associated with haemodynamic instability and collapse. TdP may also degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF)\nQT prolongation may occur secondary to multiple drug effects , electrolyte abnormalities and medical conditions; these may combine to produce TdP, e.g. hypokalaemia may precipitate TdP in a patient with congenital long QT syndrome\nRecognition of TdP and the risk of TdP allows the instigation of specific management strategies (e.g. magnesium, isoprenaline, overdrive pacing, etc.)\nFurther review of the causes of QT prolongation\n\nPathophysiology of TdP\nA prolonged QT reflects prolonged myocyte repolarisation due to ion channel malfunction\nThis prolonged repolarisation period also gives rise to early after-depolarisations (EADs)\nEADs may manifest on the ECG as tall U waves; if these reach threshold amplitude they may manifest as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)\nTdP is initiated when a PVC occurs during the preceding T wave, known as ‘R on T’ phenomenon\nThe onset of TdP is often preceded by a sequence of short-long-short R-R intervals, so called “pause dependent” TDP, with longer pauses associated with faster runs of TdP\n\nElectrocardiographic Pearls\nDuring short runs of TdP or single lead recording the characteristic “twisting” morphology may not be apparent\nBigeminy in a patient with a known long QT syndrome may herald imminent TdP\nTdP with heart rates > 220 beats/min are of longer duration and more likely to degenerate into VF\nPresence of abnormal (“giant”) T-U waves may precede TdP\n\nDrug-induced Torsades\nIn the context of acute poisoning with QT-prolonging agents, the risk of TdP is better described by the absolute rather than corrected QT\nMore precisely, the risk of TdP is determined by considering both the absolute QT interval and the simultaneous heart rate (i.e. on the same ECG tracing)\nThese values are then plotted on the QT nomogram (below) to determine whether the patient is at risk of TdP\nA QT interval-heart rate pair that plots above the line indicates that the patient is at significant risk of TdP",

  "Triple vessel disease": "Left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis\nProximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis\nSevere triple vessel disease\nHypoxia or hypotension, for example following resuscitation from cardiac arrest\nST elevation in aVR can also be seen in the context of anterior STEMI due to LAD occlusion proximal to the first septal branch, causing infarction of the basal septum. Such cases will have associated ST elevation in anteroseptal leads.\n\n\nMechanism of ST elevation (STE) in aVR\nLead aVR is electrically opposite to the left-sided leads I, II, aVL and V4-6. In the case of subendocardial ischaemia, ST elevation in aVR is simply a reciprocal change to ST depression in these leads\nST depression does not localise , and thus subendocardial ischaemia due to oxygen supply/demand mismatch produces a consistent ECG pattern of widespread ST depression, usually most prominent in leads I, II, V4-6, and reciprocal ST elevation in aVR\nLead aVR also directly records electrical activity from the right upper portion of the heart, including the right ventricular outflow tract and the basal portion of the interventricular septum. Infarction in this area could theoretically produce ST elevation in aVR\n\nCause of ST elevation (STE) in AVR\nTwo possible mechanisms:\nDiffuse subendocardial ischaemia , with widespread ST depression producing reciprocal change in aVR (most common)\nInfarction of the basal septum , i.e. a STEMI involving aVR\nThe basal septum is supplied by the first septal perforator artery (a very proximal branch of the LAD), so ischaemia / infarction of the basal septum would imply involvement of the proximal LAD.\n\nLMCA “occlusion”: a misnomer\nST elevation in aVR with coexistent multi-lead ST depression can be a sign of Non-Occlusion Myocardial Infarction (NOMI) due to severe single or multi-vessel disease, but does not usually represent acute LMCA occlusion as once thought. Such acute occlusion most often causes sudden cardiac death due to simultaneous anterior, lateral and posterior STEMI.\nMore recent publications recognise this ECG pattern as consistent with left main coronary artery subocclusion or complete occlusion with well-developed collateral circulation. A 2019 single-centre retrospective analysis identified patients presenting with STE-aVR with multilead ST depression. Coronary occlusion was found only in 10% of patients, and none of these lesions were involving the LAD or left main coronary artery\n\nPredictive Value of STE in aVR\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm indicates proximal LAD / LMCA stenosis or severe 3VD\nSTE in aVR ≥ 1mm predicts the need for CABG\nAbsence of ST elevation in aVR almost entirely excludes a significant LMCA lesion\n\nDeep Dive into the literature of aVR\nPopulation : 113 patients with unstable angina, including 20 patients with LMCA stenosis and 24 patients with 3VD\nFindings : Patients with LMCA or 3VD frequently demonstrated ST-segment depression in multiple leads (typically I, II  and V4-V6) plus ST-segment elevation in lead aVR during attacks of angina",

  "V1 and V2 Misplacement": "Misplacement of V1 and V2: Don’t let this mistake mess up your ECG interpretation!\nThe proper location of V1 and V2 have not changed in many decades. They are located in the 4 th intercostal space, just right and left, respectively, of the sternum. It is fairly easy to determine this spot using the angle of Louis as a landmark.\nHowever, V1 and V2 were being misplaced pretty much right after being invented. This error in lead positioning usually produces trivial changes in the QRS pattern in those leads, and thus no real change in ECG interpretation. But certain erroneous ECG patterns can be generated, and it is important to recognize lead misplacement as a potential cause.\n\n\n\nP wave changes\nIn the vast majority of healthy patients, V1 will have a biphasic P wave , while V2 will be upright. Upwards misplacement should be strongly suspected if the P in V1 is fully negative, or if the P in V2 is biphasic or fully negative. (If the leads are properly placed, consider e.g. atrial enlargement or an ectopic atrial rhythm.)\n\nFigure 1a : V1 and V2 are placed too high, the P wave in V1 is fully negative (red arrow), and the P wave in V2 is biphasic (red star).\nFigure 1b : The leads are  placed at their proper location, V1 shows a mostly-upright biphasic P (green arrow) and a fully upright P in V2 (green star).\n\nIncomplete Right Bundle Branch Block (rSr’pattern)\nUpwards misplacement of V1 and V2 often produces an IRBBB pattern.\nIRBBB is a normal finding, seen in healthy athletes and children. However, a falsely “ new ” IRBBB might prompt the unwary clinician to consider pulmonary embolism , among other diagnoses.\nIRBBB Example 1\n\nDetail from figure 1. The ECG computer suggested that the clinician “consider ischemia” given the ST/T pattern in V1-V3. Note the fully negative P in V1\n\nIRBBB Example 2\n\nYoung woman presents with atypical chest pain. Negative D-dimer, but clinician noted the IRBBB in first ECG (figure 3a ), raising suspicion for a PE, and a CTA was ordered. However, V1 and V2 had been placed in the 2nd intercostal space.\nWhen the ECG was repeated with V1 and V2 in 4th intercostal space (figure 3b ) the IRBBB pattern resolved. Note that the P wave in V2 is fully positive when leads are correctly located.\n\nOld “Septal MI”\nSeemingly new Q waves can be generated with high placement of V1 and V2. If there is supporting clinical context, an old septal MI can be considered, and confirmatory labs and imaging obtained. Otherwise, the ECG should be scrutinized for the signs of misplacement and repeated.\n\n\nFalse STEMI\nIn some cases, the rSr’ or qR pattern may combine with a mild degree of benign anterior ST segment elevation (aka “male pattern”). This produces a “saddle-shaped” ST segment that the computer may mistake for acute ischemia.\n\nFigure 5 : Three examples of False STEMI:\n(A) 23 y.o. man with atypical CP, negative troponin and D-dimer. The computer produced an *** Acute MI*** alert.\n(B) 35 y.o. man, asymptomatic at primary care doctor for an annual evaluation, and again the computer produced an *** Acute MI*** alert.\n(C) 20 y.o. man sent from an employment physical, computer read “consider ischemia” based on V1-V2.\nIn all three cases, the ECG patterns and computer interpretations resolved with proper lead placement of V1 and V2.\n\nT wave inversion\nT wave inversion may be normal in V1 and even V2. However, in patients with symptoms that suggest a cardiopulmonary cause, an inverted T wave must be presumed to be pathologic. Upwards misplacement of V2 can generate false T wave inversion, however, as illustrated in figure 2.\n\nBrugada – Type 2 (Not Type 1)\nV1 and V2 may be placed in the 3 rd or even 2 nd intercostal spaces in order to elicit a type 1 Brugada pattern , and is considered diagnostic.\nBy contrast, a type 2 Brugada pattern may often be found with these “high leads” are applied to healthy people, especially in fit young males. Finding type 2 Brugada in this context is not uncommon, and by itself carries no diagnostic or prognostic significance.\nA number of the examples above show a pattern that could be mistaken for type 2 Brugada.",

Most episodes occur at rest but may be triggered by exercise, stress and beta agonists. The mechanism is re-entrant tachycardia due to an ectopic focus within the left ventricle.\nNB. A similar ECG pattern of fascicular VT may occur with digoxin toxicity , but here the mechanism is enhanced automaticity in the region of the fascicles.\n\nClassification\nFascicular tachycardia can be classified based on ECG morphology corresponding to the anatomical location of the re-entry circuit:\n\n\nDiagnosis and Management\nDiagnosis can be difficult and this rhythm is often misdiagnosed as SVT with RBBB; the diagnosis is made by observing specific features of VT, e.g. fusion/capture beats, AV dissociation.\nIdiopathic fascicular tachycardia may prove difficult to treat as it is often unresponsive to adensoine, vagal maneouvers, and lignocaine. However, it characteristically responds to verapamil\nDigoxin-induced fascicular VT is responsive to Digoxin Immune Fab",

  "Ventricular tachycardia: Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) tachcyardia": "Overview\nRight ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is a form of monomorphic VT originating from the outflow tract of the right ventricle or occasionally from the tricuspid annulus. It is usually seen in patients without underlying structural heart disease.\nThe majority (80%) of outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (OTVAs) originate from the RVOT. The RVOT is divided into rightward (free wall), anterior, leftward, and posterior (septal) parts. RVOT VT can originate from any of these sites but carry common ECG characteristics.\nECG features\nLBBB morphology\nInferior axis\nrS complex in V1 and R complex in V6\nPrecordial transition usually ≥ V3, with the exception of septal origin, which occurs at ≤ V3\nOther general features of VT , such as AV dissociation, fusion and/or capture beats may also be present.\n\nCauses\nIdiopathic VT\nRVOT tachycardia is most commonly a form of idiopathic VT, whereby no structural heart disease, metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities, or long QT syndrome can be found. There are two main forms of clinical presentation:\nRepetitive, unsustained, monomorphic VT is the most common form seen in 60-90%\nExercise-induced sustained ventricular arrhythmias\nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia (ARVD)\nARVD is a genetic disorder of myocardium in which there is fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall, and accounts for up to 10% of sudden cardiac death in individuals under 65 years of age. Affected individuals often present with exercise-induced episodes of VT accompanied by LBBB morphology.\nDifferentiation between idiopathic RVOT tachycardia and that caused by ARVD can be difficult and may rely on previous ECG findings as well as family history.\nClinical implications\nRVOT tachycardia can be difficult to distinguish from SVT with LBBB\nInferior axis (+90 degrees) is usually the most differentiating feature, but other features of VT such as AV dissociation may be present\nTreatment:\nAcute termination of idiopathic RVOT tachycardia in a stable patient can be achieved by vagal manoeuvres or adenosine (6mg up to 24mg)\nIV verapamil is an alternative if the patient has an adequate blood pressure reserve\nRVOT tachycardia in ARVD does not terminate with adenosine\nIn stable patients with a regular broad complex tachycardia, adenosine is useful and safe as a diagnostic and potentially therapeutic agent.",
  "VT versus SVT with aberrancy": "Regular broad complex tachycardias can be ventricular (VT) or supraventricular (SVT with aberrancy) in origin, and differentiation between the two will significantly influence management of your patients.\nUnfortunately, the electrocardiographic differentiation of VT from SVT with aberrancy is not always possible.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of regular broad complex tachycardia\nVentricular tachycardia (VT)\nSupraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction due to bundle branch block\nSVT with any metabolic disturbance that slows supraventricular action potential propagation — hyperkalaemia , sodium channel blockade , severe acidosis\nAntidromic AVRT — re-entrant tachyarrhythmia seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\nAccelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR)\n\nECG features increasing the likelihood of VT\nElectrocardiographic features that increase the likelihood of VT include:\nAbsence of typical RBBB or LBBB morphology\nExtreme axis deviation (“northwest axis”): QRS positive in aVR and negative in I and aVF\nVery broad complexes > 160ms\nAV dissociation:\nP and QRS complexes at different rates\nP waves are often superimposed on QRS complexes and may be difficult to discern\nCapture beats : Occur when the sinoatrial node transiently “captures” the ventricles in the midst of AV dissociation, producing a QRS complex of normal duration\nFusion beats : Occur when a sinus and ventricular beat coincide to produce a hybrid complex (see Dressler beat )\n\nPositive concordance throughout the precordial leads:\n\nNegative concordance throughout the precordial leads:\n\nRSR’ complexes with a taller left rabbit ear:\nThis is the most specific finding in favour of VT\nThis is in contrast to RBBB , where the right rabbit ear is taller\n\nBrugada sign: Distance from onset of R wave to nadir of S wave is > 100ms in leads V1-6 (discussed further below)\nJosephson sign : Notching/slurring near the nadir of the S wave\n\n\nClinical factors associated with VT or SVT\nThe likelihood of VT is increased with:\nAge > 35 (positive predictive value of 85%)\nStructural heart disease\nIschaemic heart disease\nPrevious MI\nFamily history of sudden cardiac death (suggesting conditions such as HOCM, congenital long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia that are associated with episodes of VT)\nThe likelihood of SVT with aberrancy is increased if:\nPrevious ECGs show a bundle branch block pattern with identical morphology to the broad complex tachycardia\nPrevious ECGs show evidence of WPW (short PR < 120ms, broad QRS, delta wave)\nThe patient has a history of paroxysmal tachycardias that have been successfully terminated with adenosine or vagal manoeuvres",
  "Wellens Syndrome": "Wellens Syndrome is a clinical syndrome characterised by biphasic or deeply inverted T waves in V2-3, plus a history of recent chest pain now resolved. It is highly specific for critical stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD)\nWellens pattern A : Biphasic T waves Wellens pattern B : Deeply inverted T waves\nThe pattern is usually present in the pain free state — it may be obscured during episodes of ischaemic chest pain, when there is “pseudonormalisation” of T waves in V2-3\nWellens syndrome is a key example of why all patients presenting with chest pain must have serial ECGs\n\nClinical significance\nPatients may be pain free by the time the ECG is taken, and have normal or minimally elevated cardiac enzymes. However, they are at extremely high risk for extensive anterior wall MI within the subsequent days to weeks\nDue to the critical LAD stenosis, these patients usually require invasive therapy, do poorly with medical management, and may suffer MI or cardiac arrest if inappropriately stress tested\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nRhinehart et al (2002) describe the following diagnostic criteria for Wellens syndrome:\nDeeply inverted or biphasic T waves in V2-3 (may extend to V1-6)\nECG pattern present in pain-free state\nIsoelectric or minimally-elevated ST segment (< 1mm)\nNo precordial Q waves\nPreserved precordial R wave progression\nRecent history of angina\nNormal or slightly elevated serum cardiac markers\n\nThere are two patterns of T-wave abnormality in Wellens syndrome:\nType A – Biphasic, with initial positivity and terminal negativity (25% of cases)\nType B – Deeply and symmetrically inverted (75% of cases)\nBiphasic T Waves (Type A)\nWellens Pattern A (Type 1) Wellens Pattern A (Type 1)\n\nDeeply Inverted T Waves (Type B)\n\nWellens T wave evolution\nT wave changes can evolve over time from Type A to Type B pattern ( Smith et al ).\nEvolution of T-wave inversion [A-D] after coronary reperfusion in STEMI reperfusion and in Wellens syndrome (NSTEMI). Modified from Smith et al. Evolution of T-wave inversion. The ECG in acute MI, 2002\n\nUnderstanding T wave changes\nThe following sequence of events is thought to occur in patients with Wellens syndrome:\nA sudden complete occlusion of the LAD causes a transient anterior STEMI, causing chest pain & diaphoresis. This stage may not be successfully captured on an ECG recording\nRe-perfusion of the LAD (e.g. due to spontaneous clot lysis or prehospital aspirin) leads to resolution of chest pain. ST elevation improves and T waves become biphasic or inverted. The T wave morphology is identical to patients who reperfuse after a successful PCI\nIf the artery remains open, the T waves evolve over time from biphasic to deeply inverted\nThe coronary perfusion is unstable, however, and the LAD can re-occlude at any time. If this happens, the first sign on the ECG is an apparent normalisation of the T waves — so-called “pseudo-normalisation” . The T waves switch from biphasic/inverted to upright and prominent. This is a sign of hyperacute STEMI and is usually accompanied by recurrence of chest pain, although the ECG changes can precede the symptoms\nIf the artery remains occluded, the patient now develops an evolving anterior STEMI\nAlternatively, a “stuttering” pattern may develop, with intermittent reperfusion and re-occlusion. This would manifest as alternating ECGs demonstrating Wellens and pseudonormalisation/STEMI patterns\nThis sequence of events is not limited to the anterior leads — similar changes may be seen in the inferior or lateral leads, e.g. with RCA or circumflex occlusion.\nAlso, the inciting event does not necessarily have to be thrombus formation — Wellens syndrome may also occur in normal coronary arteries following an episode of vasospasm, as in this case of cocaine-induced vasospasm . However, it is safer to assume the worst (i.e. critical LAD stenosis) and work the patient up for an angiogram.\nThe concept of occlusion/reperfusion/re-occlusion is explained by Dr Stephen Smith . Also check out Example 5, below.\n\nHistory of Wellens Syndrome\n1979 – Gerson et al first described the occurrence of exercise-induced U wave inversion (inverted terminal T-waves) in the precordial leads in patients with proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) ischemia. 33/36 patients (92%) with this abnormality had >75% stenosis in the proximal LAD.\n1980 – Gerson further evaluated ‘U-wave inversion ‘, this time at rest, and found 24/27 (89%) of patients with the ECG findings had evidence of LAD or left main ischemia.\n1982 – De Zwaan, Wellens et al reported a similar ECG abnormality without mentioning inverted U-waves. They observed that patients admitted for unstable angina with this ECG finding were at high risk for myocardial infarction.\n\nSemantic nomenclature\nThere is confusion in the literature regarding the naming of the T wave patterns, with some authors using Type 1 (Type A) for biphasic T waves and Type 2 (Type B) for inverted. It may be better to just describe the T wave pattern!\nOriginal description**\nECG patterns in precordial leads of the patients reported.

  "Wolff-Parkinson White Syndrome": "This page covers the pathophysiology and ECG features of pre-excitation syndromes in sinus rhythm. The two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur due to accessory pathways are discussed separately — see atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT) and atrial fibrillation/flutter in pre-excitation .\n\nOverview of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome\nWPW Syndrome refers to the presence of a congenital accessory pathway (AP) and episodes of tachyarrhythmias. The term is often used interchangeablely with pre-excitation syndrome\nFirst described in 1930 by Louis Wolff , John Parkinson and Paul Dudley White\nIncidence is 0.1 – 3.0 per 1000\nAssociated with a small risk of sudden cardiac death\n\nECG features of WPW in sinus rhythm\nPR interval < 120ms\nDelta wave : slurring slow rise of initial portion of the QRS\nQRS prolongation > 110ms\nDiscordant ST-segment and T-wave changes (i.e. in the opposite direction to the major component of the QRS complex)\nPseudo-infarction pattern in up to 70% of patients — due to negatively deflected delta waves in inferior/anterior leads (“pseudo-Q waves”), or prominent R waves in V1-3 (mimicking posterior infarction)\n\n\nAberrant conduction via an AP leads to early ventricular depolarisation (pre-excitation), which manifests as a short PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex\nConduction still occurs via the AV node, and is actually a brake on AP conduction, ceasing its propagation path in the ventricle\nQRS duration is thus prolonged, but not to the same extent as in bundle branch block\nBecause there is an initial abnormal direction of depolarisation (e.g. originating from left ventricle in left-sided AP), there will be an abnormal direction of repolarisation. This produces appropriately discordant ST segment and T wave changes (see above diagram)\n\nPathophysiology of pre-excitation and APs\nPre-excitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an AP. Also known as bypass tracts, APs are abnormal conduction pathways formed during cardiac development and can exist in a variety of anatomical locations and in some patients there may be multiple pathways. In WPW, the AP is sometimes referred to as the Bundle of Kent , or atrioventricular bypass tract.\n\nAn AP can conduct impulses in three ways:\nIn both directions (majority)\nRetrograde only , away from the ventricle (15%)\nAnterograde only , towards the ventricle (rare)\nThe direction of conduction affects the appearance of the ECG in sinus rhythm and during tachyarrhythmias.\nAPs can be left-sided or right-sided , and ECG features will vary depending on this:\nLeft-sided AP: produces a positive delta wave in all precordial leads, with R/S > 1 in V 1 . Sometimes referred to as a type A WPW pattern\nRight-sided AP: produces a negative delta wave in leads V 1 and V 2 . Sometimes referred to as a type B WPW pattern\nNote that the features of pre-excitation may be subtle, or present only intermittently. Pre-excitation may be more pronounced with increased vagal tone e.g. during Valsalva manoeuvres, or with AV blockade e.g. drug therapy.\n\nConcealed pathway\nIn patients with retrograde-only accessory conduction, all anterograde conduction occurs via the AV node. No pre-excitation occurs and therefore no features of WPW are seen on the ECG in sinus rhythm. This is termed a “concealed pathway”. These patients can still experience tachyarrhythmias, as the pathway can still form part of a re-entry circuit.\n\nTachyarrhythmias in WPW\nThere are only two main forms of tachyarrhythmias that occur in patients with WPW — these are discussed separately:\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter . Due to direct conduction from atria to ventricles via an AP, bypassing the AV node\nAtrioventricular re-entry tachycardia (AVRT). Due to formation of a re-entry circuit involving the AP\n\n\nOther Pre-Excitation Syndromes / Accessory Pathways\nLown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) Syndrome\nProposed pre-excitation syndrome. AP composed of James fibres.\nECG features:\nPR interval < 120ms\nNormal QRS morphology\nThe term should not be used in the absence of paroxysmal tachycardia. Existence is disputed.\n\nMahaim-Type Pre-excitation\nRight sided APs connecting either AV node to ventricles, fascicles to ventricles, or atria to fascicles.\nECG features:\nSinus rhythm ECG may be normal\nMay result in variation in ventricular morphology\nRe-entry tachycardia typically has LBBB morphology",
