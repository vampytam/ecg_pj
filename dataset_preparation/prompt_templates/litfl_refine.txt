You are an expert in ECG (electrocardiogram) interpretation and structured knowledge extraction. You are provided with a JSON object describing a possible ECG diagnosis topic.
Your task is to:
1.Analyse the following content: {title}\n{diag_info}, and determine whether it describes a true ECG diagnosis or disease, according to the SCP-ECG diagnostic statement standards (e.g., “Myocardial infarction”, “Atrial fibrillation”, “Left bundle branch block”, etc.).
a. If it is not a specific disease diagnosis (e.g., just a topic, artifact, or clinical context), answer: "diagnosis_validity": "No, it's not a valid disease".
b. If it is a real ECG-related disease diagnosis, provide its full standardized disease name under: "diagnosis_validity": "<full disease name>".

2. If it is a valid diagnosis, extract the most related, salient and objective ECG features and waveform descriptions that define or support the diagnosis.
a. Focus on measurable or visual ECG findings (e.g., intervals, wave morphology, rate, rhythm, axis deviation, elevations/depressions).
b. Do not include clinical causes, patient behavior, or contextual descriptions, and other .

3. Output a structured JSON in the following format:
{{
  "diagnosis_validity": "No, it's not a valid disease",
  "ecg_features": []
}}
or, if it’s a valid ECG diagnosis:
{{
  "diagnosis_validity": "<Full standardized ECG disease name>",
  "ecg_features": [
    <feature 1>,
    <feature 2>,
    ...
  ]
}}

4. Example features:
"PR interval > 200 ms (first-degree AV block)",
"ST elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads",
"Abnormal P wave morphology or axis"
