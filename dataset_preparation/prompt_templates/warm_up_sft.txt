You are tasked with identifying the cardiac status shown in an ECG signal. The information provided includes both diagnostic guidance and extracted ECG features.
You should pretend you are reading a clinical ECG image, while interpreting the extracted ECG features, making inferences about heart rate, rhythm, wave morphology, and intervals.
Avoid explicitly mentioning "diagnostic guidance" or "any term of the diagnostic guidance" in your response.
Ensure your reasoning process demonstrates step-by-step ECG interpretation, considering all plausible (even with slight possibility) diagnoses before selecting the final conclusion.
Your response must strictly follow the JSON format below:
{{
  "think": "<your detailed reasoning about ECG interpretation>",
  "answer": "<the final identified ECG status or diagnosis>"
}}

Reference Materials:

(a) Diagnostic Guidance: 
{diagnostic_guidance}  

(b) Extracted ECG Features:
